07.18.2018	Washington, D.C. – House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Representatives Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), Michael Conaway (R-Texas), and Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) today introduced the bipartisan AG and Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 6417). Representatives Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chair of the House Freedom Caucus, Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chair of the Republican Study Committee, and John Katko (R-N.Y.), chair of the Tuesday Group, are also original cosponsors. The AG and Legal Workforce Act replaces the outdated and broken H-2A agricultural guestworker program with a new, workable agricultural guestworker program, known as the H-2C program, to ensure America’s farmers and ranchers have access to a reliable workforce. The H-2C program is available to both seasonal and year-round agricultural employers, provides a generous visa allocation to ensure labor needs are met, provides much needed flexibility to minimize disruptions in farm operations, eliminates regulatory burdens, and contains effective accountability and enforcement provisions. These provisions are supported by over 200 agricultural groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation. The AG and Legal Workforce Act also requires all U.S. employers to use E-Verify, an effective web-based program that protects jobs for legal workers. The bill repeals the error-prone, paper-based I-9 system and replaces it with E-Verify. It contains a gradual phase-in for employers—starting with the largest employers first and eventually phasing in small businesses and agricultural employers. Below are statements on the introduction of the AG and Legal Workforce Act. Chairman Goodlatte: “The AG and Legal Workforce Act addresses two of the most pressing issues facing our immigration system: illegal immigration and the need for a workable agricultural guestworker program for America’s farmers and ranchers. To address illegal immigration, the bill gradually rolls out E-Verify nation-wide to ensure jobs are protected for legal workers. E-Verify – a user-friendly, web-based program that quickly confirms 99% of work-eligible employees – takes less than two minutes to use and is an effective tool to combat illegal immigration. “Importantly, the AG and Legal Workforce Act also creates a new, workable agricultural guestworker program to ensure labor demands are met and crops get to market on time. The bill incorporates many of the comments and concerns I have heard from the agriculture community over the past several years. When not enough Americans can be found to fill jobs, the bill ensures that American farmers have access to a reliable workforce to fill positions needed to keep their farms afloat. The agricultural community has waited far too long for a workable guestworker program and it’s past time to enact a solution.” Congressman Peterson: “Farmers and ranchers across the country have repeatedly told us of their need for a reliable workforce. This will help to move that process forward and address an issue that is long overdue.” Congressman Smith: “Expanding the E-Verify system accomplishes two goals: it protects jobs for American workers and reduces illegal immigration by cutting off the jobs magnet. Requiring all U.S. employers to check the work authorization of new employees ensures that the jobs only go to Americans and legal workers. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that 82% of voters favor requiring business owners to check the immigration status of employees they hire. E-Verify receives the most public support of any proposed immigration reform.” Congressman Cuellar: “The Ag and Legal Workforce Act will help us meet important goals and offers vast improvements over the existing H-2A program. This bill will help address the shortage of workers that the agricultural industry has been experiencing over the years by ensuring that there is a steady flow of labor. It will also allow experienced agricultural workers who are currently undocumented in the U.S. to join and participate in the H-2C program and work here legally. I respectfully ask for bipartisan support and urge swift passage of the Ag and Legal Workforce Act for America’s hardworking agricultural producers and farm workers.” Congressman Newhouse: “The current labor shortage facing farmers must be improved by fixing the legal guest worker program. Farmers and our rural economy are being harmed by the current bureaucratic system that is not even available to all of agriculture. In order to continue domestic production of our own safe and affordable food in the U.S., Congress must pass legislation to reform our guest worker program and provide a stable, legal workforce for agriculture. I applaud the Speaker and Majority Leader for their commitment to bring this to the floor.” Congressman Conaway: “We need an ag worker program that respects our nation’s immigration laws and keeps American agriculture competitive. This bill takes important steps to cut red tape and institutes a flexible program that accounts for the different labor needs of various producers. Chairman Goodlatte has been very responsive to the concerns of the ag community, and I look forwarding to working with him to help shepherd this legislation through the House.” Congressman Calvert: “I commend Chairman Goodlatte and Representative Lamar Smith for their dedication and hard work on one of the toughest issues our Conference, and the Congress, faces: illegal immigration. The bill introduced today takes a monumental step towards ending the incentive that brings people here illegally: mandating the use of E-Verify. However, we need to be realistic about the labor needs of the agricultural industry and that is why this bill includes a workable guest labor program. I am grateful to the Chairman for the additional modifications that have gone even farther to accommodate agricultural labor needs. The time to act is now and I look forward to supporting this bill on the Floor.” Additional original cosponsors of the bill are: Representatives Ralph Abraham (R-La.), Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), Andy Barr (R-Ky.), Ken Buck (R-Colo.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Tom Cole (R-Okla.), Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Rick Crawford (R-Ark.), John Curtis (R-Utah), Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), Neal Dunn (R-Fla.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), John Faso (R-N.Y.), Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Andy Harris (R-Md.), Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.), Walter Jones (R-N.C.), Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), Tom Marino (R-Pa.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), Dennis Ross (R-Fla.), David Rouzer (R-N.C.), Austin Scott (R-Ga.), Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.), Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), Fred Upton (R-Mich.), and Ted Yoho (R-Fla.).

07.13.2018	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressmen Lamar Smith (TX-21), Roger Williams (TX-25), Michael McCaul (TX-10) and John Carter (TX-31) announced that the U.S. Army selected Austin, Texas as the site for its Futures Command Center. Last month, members of the Texas Delegation sent a letter to U.S. Army Secretary Mark Esper in support of the Austin Mega Region as the future basing location for the next Army Futures Command. “This is tremendous news for central Texas. The Army Futures Command will bring hundreds of jobs to the Austin area. With its excellent academic institutions and established technology sector, Austin will be of great help to the Command,” said Rep. Smith. “I look forward to Texas playing an even greater role in securing our country by welcoming this newest defense center.” “This is great news for the State of Texas and the United States. Austin is the fastest growing city in the nation, and I cannot think of a location more fit to serve as the modernization and innovation hub for the United States Army. It creates a unique synergy between the military, academia and industry partners, unified in their goal to provide soldiers with the weapons and equipment that they need to fight and win,” said Rep. Williams. “As a resident and the representative of Austin, I welcome the Army Futures Command, and look forward to working with them to ensure the Army remains the best trained and equipped fighting force in the world.” “I cannot think of a better place for the Army Futures Command Center to be located. Austin, my hometown, is a booming tech-hub with close ties to the U.S. Armed Forces. We already host some of the U.S. military’s newest innovative research and development investments, including the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, the Army Research Lab South, and the Air Force’s ‘AFWERXs.’ I know this addition will serve as great help to the Command,” Rep. McCaul said. While it will provide more jobs for TX-10, our innovative environment will also ensure our nation maintains the best of the best in our military. As the proud son of a WWII B-17 bombardier, I look forward to continuing to support this new defense center.” “I’m proud to have secured the last bit of funding necessary, with the help of Defense Appropriations Chairwoman Kay Granger, to make Austin the new home of Futures Command,” Rep. Carter said. “As the command tasked with spearheading Army modernization projects and preparing for future conflict, the new Futures Command will serve a critical role in strengthening the security of our country and will be an economic driver for the Central Texas region. This major investment in Central Texas will also immediately bring 500 new jobs, and further strengthen Central Texas’ economy. Central Texas is one of the fastest growing regions in the nation, with outstanding universities, affordable housing, and a commitment to America’s military that can’t be matched. I expect to see many of these new Texas residents plant their roots right here in Texas’ 31st Congressional District and we welcome them with open arms.” ###
07.09.2018	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. Rep. Smith: “With his pick of Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump named a very qualified and distinguished jurist. I am optimistic that as a Supreme Court Associate Justice Kavanaugh would not legislate from the bench, would adhere to the Constitution and not let his political views influence his legal decisions. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will give Judge Kavanaugh fair consideration and confirm him quickly. ” ###
06.27.2018	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today opposed the “compromise” Border Security and Immigration Reform Act. The bill was defeated by a vote of 121-301. Rep. Smith: “This bill means more amnesty and less enforcement. It gives amnesty to millions and will lead to the widespread use of fraudulent documents to obtain amnesty. The bill also allows millions of illegal immigrants to stop their deportation simply by claiming they are eligible for amnesty. “And there is no guarantee that any border structure will be built. It’s amnesty today and border security sometime in the future, if then. “The bill also omits workforce verification, which is the most effective tool to fight illegal immigration and save jobs for American workers.”
06.26.2018	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding President Trump’s executive action that strengthened vetting of immigrants who come from countries that have been designated as a security threat. Rep. Smith: “As the Supreme Court ruled, President Trump’s executive order is fully within the president’s power under our country’s immigration laws. “He is lawfully protecting innocent Americans from those who enter the United States to do us harm. We ought to take every reasonable step possible to protect the American people from terrorism. Foreign nationals from countries that pose national security threats should not be admitted until they can be properly vetted by our national security agencies.”
06.21.2018	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) gave the following statement on his vote in support of the Securing America’s Future Act (H.R. 4760). Rep. Smith: “The Securing America’s Future Act secures our borders, implements workforce verification to end the illegal jobs magnet, reduces chain immigration, bolsters interior enforcement, and prevents abuse of our asylum laws. “The bill delivers on the president’s pledge to voters to complete physical barriers along our southern border, penalize lawless sanctuary cities, and end the Obama Administration’s catch-and-release policy that returns dangerous criminal immigrants to our streets to prey on innocent Americans. “Of special interest to me is the inclusion in the bill of the Legal Workforce Act, which requires all new employees’ work eligibility to be verified. This will reduce illegal immigration and save jobs for American workers." *** Watch video of Rep. Smith speaking about the Securing America’s Future Act here. ###
06.14.2018	WASHINGTON – Congressman Smith issued the following response to the Department of Justice Inspector General’s report on FBI action ahead of the 2016 election and their handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State: Rep. Smith: “It is a sad day for a very respected institution. Many at the FBI, including former director James Comey, did not act professionally. It is clear that many of their actions were politically motivated, including inexcusable leaks to media that were undoubtedly intended to damage then-candidate Trump. It’s regrettable that Hillary Clinton received favorable treatment that would not have been given to any usual citizen. It’s possible she violated criminal laws and was not held accountable.” ###

Bush have been long-time friends and were very helpful when I started my career in Congress. The family has done much for the state of Texas and our country. As first lady, Mrs. Bush focused on literacy and dyslexia, causes near to hearts of millions of Americans. Her efforts brought the gift of reading to countless children. The country rightfully celebrates her life and accomplishments.”
04.17.2018	Washington, DC – Today, April 17, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) gave the following statement on Tax Day. Rep. Smith: “We’re celebrating Tax Day this year because April 17 marks the last time that taxpayers will ever have to deal with the old, broken tax code. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought the biggest change to the tax code in more than 30 years. The bill reduces taxes, gives bigger paychecks to families and continues to create new jobs for Americans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces taxes for 80 percent of all households and 90 percent of wage earners will take home more pay. “The reforms are in full effect allowing for simpler tax filing and relief from Obamacare’s individual mandate for next year’s Tax Day. “This week in the House, we’re also considering nine bills that redesign the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), enhance customer service, improve the IRS’s vastly outdated IT infrastructure, and modernize the appeals process. We are taking the biggest and boldest step in 20 years to reform the IRS with a singular mission: ‘Taxpayer First.’”
04.12.2018	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Smith voted for a balanced budget amendment (H.J. Res. 2) to the Constitution to restore fiscal responsibility and accountability to federal government spending. The proposal for a balanced budget amendment did not pass in the House with a vote of 233-184. Congressman Lamar Smith: “American families balance their checkbooks and so should the government. I was a member of the Budget Committee when we achieved the last balanced budget. And I have co-sponsored other balanced budget amendments to the Constitution. I will continue to support legislation that reduces federal spending, the deficit, and the national debt.” Background: This bill requires the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress annually. Congress is authorized to waive these requirements when a declaration of war is in effect or if the United States is engaged in military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security. Watch video of Congressman Smith speaking about the Balanced Budget Amendment on the House floor here.
04.11.2018	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) gave the following statement on Speaker Paul Ryan’s announcement that he will retire at the end of his term. Congressman Smith: “It has been a great pleasure to serve with Speaker Paul Ryan in the People’s House for nearly 20 years. He is a real workhorse and I understand how after much time away on the job he is making this decision to be with his family. “Speaker Ryan has provided conservative leadership needed to enact important legislation for the American people. His legacy in Congress will be that of fighting for taxpayers – last year the House passed and the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the biggest update to the tax code in more than 30 years. The bill reduced taxes, has given bigger paychecks to families and is continuing to result in new jobs for Americans. “Also important to Texas’ 21st district, Speaker Ryan has prioritized rebuilding our country’s military by advancing legislation that makes the investments needed to get our troops ready to deploy, get our planes and pilots back in the air, and rebuild military infrastructure. I look forward to serving out the rest of this Congress with Speaker Ryan.”
03.21.2018	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith voted in support of the Right to Try Act of 2018, which expands terminal patients’ access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.

Smith: “Americans deserve the right to try and save their lives. I am disappointed that Democrats voted down this fair and compassionate bill last week. And I’m glad we are considering it again this week. “Today a majority of members of congress supported the Right-to-Try legislation. It creates an alternative path for patients who do not qualify for formal clinical trials. It allows patients to have greater access to unapproved therapies and treatments while ensuring proper patient protections are in place. Expediting the process for treatment will give patients more hope for a successful recovery.” ###
02.26.2018	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith gave the following statement on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (USCIS) updated mission statement. Last year the House Judiciary Committee approved a similar revised mission statement as part of legislation to reauthorize USCIS. Rep. Smith: “The updated USCIS mission statement demonstrates the agency’s commitment to protect American workers and taxpayers first. By safeguarding the integrity of the immigration process and preventing fraud, USCIS executes it duties as required by law. USCIS leadership should be thanked for carrying out this important mission on behalf of the American people.” USCIS Mission Statement: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services administers the nation's lawful immigration system, safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our values.

02.02.2018	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) gave the following statement on the House Intelligence Committee’s FISA memo. Rep. Smith: “The implications of the memo are devastating to democracy. A major law enforcement division of the U.S. government wrongly involved themselves in a presidential campaign. It would be understandable if the President and Attorney General wanted to clean house and fire anyone who used a political file compiled by the Clinton campaign as a reason to spy on American citizens.” ###
01.30.2018	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith gave the following statement in response to President Trump’s first State of the Union Address. Rep. Smith: “President Trump has succeeded in carrying out many of his policy goals he laid out a year ago in his joint address to Congress.

The president’s policies are helping Americans get back to work, pay less in taxes, and build their retirement and savings accounts. “I look forward to continuing work with President Trump to build a safe, strong and proud America.”
01.26.2018	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement in response to the framework on immigration reform released by the White House. Congressman Smith: “I am disappointed in the administration’s immigration proposal. There is not much interior enforcement and it doesn’t include workforce verification, which would protect jobs for American workers. This proposal grants amnesty today and delays legal immigration reforms until a distant tomorrow. It is not a good deal for the American people. Immigration policy should put the interests of American workers and taxpayers first.” Representative Smith is the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and its immigration subcommittee. ###
01.20.2018	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) gave the following statement on the Senate Democrats' vote to shut down the federal government. Rep. Smith: “The American people can count. “Forty-four Senate Democrats voted to shut down the government. Only four Senate Republicans wanted to do the same. “So ten times as many Democrats as Republicans supported denying funds to our military, to children’s healthcare, and to everyday Americans. “The Senate Democrats must be held accountable. Their actions halted government services. They can’t blame anyone else. “The numbers don’t lie and the American people can count. Forty-four Senate Democrats voted to shut down the government. “Let’s hope they change their mind and vote to get back to work. We have much to do to make America great.”
01.19.2018	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted in support of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act which passed in the House by a vote of 241-183. Rep. Smith: “Today we celebrate and protect life. While thousands march across Washington today to recognize the dignity of human life, here in the House of Representatives we voted on critical legislation for children. “The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act helps ensure children born alive during an abortion procedure receive the same professional medical care as any other child born alive.”
01.10.2018	WASHINGTON – In a speech on the House floor Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Lamar Smith (TX-21) spoke on how Congress should include an E-Verify employment verification program in any immigration reform package. Include E-Verify in Immigration Reform Package Congress should include an E-Verify employment eligibility verification program in any immigration reform package. E-Verify is the most effective deterrent to illegal immigration because it shuts off the jobs magnet and saves jobs for hardworking Americans. It’s no surprise that E-Verify receives the most public support – 82 percent – of any proposed immigration reform. The E-Verify legislation, the Legal Workforce Act, approved by the Judiciary Committee has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and immigration enforcement groups. It provides employers with an efficient and workable system to verify their employees’ work status. And the requirement for employers to verify their workers only applies to new employees – not existing workers. Members should hesitate to support any immigration reform package that does not include requiring employers to use E-Verify. Congress should put the interests of American workers first. ###
12.19.2017	WASHINGTON – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted in support of the final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which raises take-home pay and creates jobs. The bill passed 227-203. Rep. Smith: “Today we kept our promise to the American people by passing pro-family, pro-growth tax reform for working Americans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is the biggest update to the tax code in more than 30 years. The bill creates jobs, reduces taxes and gives bigger paychecks to families. “This bill increases the child tax credit from $1000 to $2000 to provide more support for Texans to take care of their children. Over 45,000 taxpayers in the 21st district will benefit from the child credit increase. The standard deductions for both single and married filers are also doubled. The typical family making the median income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of more than $2000. That’s $2,000 more of their earned income that they can use as they choose, and that’s not going to the government’s coffers. “The tax rates for small and family-owned businesses and corporations are reduced. This encourages companies to bring their foreign profits and jobs back to the U.S. for American workers. “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also eliminates Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty tax, providing families the flexibility to make their own health care choices.” ###
12.06.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) gave the following statement on his vote in support of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 38). Congressman Smith is an original co-sponsor of the legislation. The bill passed in the House by a vote of 231-198. Rep. Smith: “As a carrier of a Concealed Handgun License, I support this bill that allows for citizens with concealed carry permits to carry a concealed firearm in other states so long as the other state doesn’t prohibit it. “The bill also includes commonsense measures to ensure our existing gun laws are enforced.”
12.05.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith gave the following statement commenting on the SECURE Act which was introduced today in the Senate. Rep. Smith: “I appreciate the efforts by my colleagues in the Senate to strengthen our immigration laws. “The SECURE Act helps reduce illegal immigration by boosting border security and interior enforcement and ensures that the biometric entry-exit program is finally implemented to track visa overstayers. It also reduces chain migration by prioritizing immediate family members of U.S. residents. “Despite these reforms, the bill falls short in significant areas. The DACA provisions are broader than necessary and require additional measures to prevent massive fraud. Universal E-Verify for all new hires is omitted from the package, missing an important opportunity to save jobs for American workers. “I cannot support the legislation in its current form and hope it will be improved. I want to help my colleagues in the Senate and the House enact immigration policies that reduce illegal immigration and put the interests of American workers and taxpayers first.”
11.16.2017	WASHINGTON – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted in support of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which raises take-home pay and creates jobs. The bill passed 227-205. Rep. Smith: “Today we kept our promise to the American people by passing pro-family, pro-growth tax reform for working Americans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act creates jobs, reduces taxes and gives bigger paychecks to families. “This bill raises incomes for families in Texas by an average of $2,558. This bill increases the child tax credit from $1000 to $1600 to provide more support for Texans taking care of their children. Over 45,000 taxpayers in the 21st district will benefit from the child credit increase. “The legislation also simplifies the tax code – nine out of ten Americans will be able to file their taxes on a form the size of a post card. “The tax rates for small and family-owned businesses and corporations are reduced. This encourages companies to bring their foreign profits and jobs back to the U.S. for American workers.” ###
11.14.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted to provide critical resources for our national security with his support for the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

Sam Houston and over 60,000 active duty servicemembers, veterans and their families. Congressman Smith gave the following statement on the bill. Rep. Smith: “Today we are providing the means to rebuild and maintain our military. The 2.4 percent pay raise in the bill is the highest in eight years. The legislation also increases the number of troops, provides greater training opportunities, and prioritizes the restoration and modernization of our military facilities. ###

I look forward to continuing working with him over the next 14 months on policies that keep Americans safe and uphold the rule of law.”
11.05.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement today in response to the tragic shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, TX. Rep. Smith: “I’m deeply saddened by the news coming out of Sutherland Springs. We’re continuing to learn updates on the tragic shooting in which 26 innocent lives were taken and more injured. Thank you to all those in South Texas – law enforcement, first responders, medical staff and others – who have come together to help victims and their loved ones.”
10.26.2017	Washington, DC – Today Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted in support of the final budget for FY2018 (Senate Amendment to the FY2018 Budget Resolution) which establishes the budget for the United States government for fiscal year 2018 and sets budget levels for the next ten years. The budget passed by a vote of 216-212. Rep. Smith: “With this budget, we put our economic house in order by reining in out-of-control spending. We also give Congress the go-ahead on much-needed tax reform to provide relief to all Americans.” Congressman Smith spoke on the House floor Thursday morning about how we need to reduce the tax burden on hard-working Americans – watch video of his speech here.
10.25.2017	WASHINGTON – Today, legislation authored and introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to save jobs for American workers and reduce illegal immigration passed the House Judiciary Committee. The Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 3711) requires U.S. employers to check the work eligibility of all new hires through the E-Verify system. Congressman Smith has a long-standing interest in E-Verify’s success since his 1996 immigration bill, which became law, created the pilot for the verification system. Congressman Smith was joined in introducing the bill by coauthors House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), and Congressman Ken Calvert (R-Calif.). The bill passed by a vote of 20-10. Congressman Smith: “The Legal Workforce Act saves jobs for American workers at a time when nearly 20 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, seven million people are working in the United States illegally. By expanding the E-Verify system to all U.S. employers, employers will check the work authorization of new employees to ensure that the jobs only go to Americans and legal workers. “E-Verify is easy to use and liked by the American people. A September 2017 Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that 82% of voters favor requiring business owners to check the immigration status of employees they hire. E-Verify receives the most public support of any proposed immigration reform. “I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Congressman Calvert for their continued commitment to this legislation and to securing our border.” E-Verify, which is operated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), checks the social security numbers of newly hired employees against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records to help ensure that they are genuinely eligible to work in the U.S. The program quickly confirms 99% of work-eligible employees and takes less than two minutes to use. Over 740,000 American employers currently use E-Verify and 83% of America’s employers support a mandatory electronic verification system. In a short video, Congressman Smith explains how to use E-Verify. Video of Congressman Smith’s opening statement at the mark-up hearing for the Legal Workforce Act can be watched here. In September, Rep. Smith held a press conference on announcing the introduction of this legislation, and another bill he introduced the Immigration in the National Interest Act. Video of the press conference can be found here. ###
10.13.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement today in response to President Trump’s announcement of policy changes toward Iran: Rep. Smith: “President Trump’s policy change towards Iran is a positive step for U.S. foreign policy. The current Iran deal does not prohibit Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and allows Iran to obtain intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the sole purpose of which is to deliver nuclear warheads. “We must not allow Iran to continue to fund terrorism, obtain nuclear warheads, and threaten our allies in the Middle East, including Israel.”
10.12.2017	Washington, DC – Today Rep. Lamar Smith voted to provide $36.5 billion in funding that includes disaster relief for those areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. This package increases resources for the Disaster Relief Fund, the federal government’s primary emergency relief program. In September, Rep. Smith voted for a bill the House passed, and the White House quickly signed into law, which provided the first round of emergency funding following Hurricane Harvey. Rep. Smith: “This continues our commitment to providing federal resources for first responders as they help those affected with debris removal, the repair and restoration of public infrastructure, and financial assistance. This will directly benefit Texans recovering and rebuilding from the devastation brought by Hurricane Harvey.”
10.08.2017	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement in response to the Trump Administration’s immigration priorities. Congressman Smith: “I support the priorities in President Trump’s immigration reform outline. We need to know who's coming into the country. We need to save jobs for American workers. We need to protect American taxpayers. We need to have immigrants respect our laws and we need to keep our communities safe from criminal immigrants. “Many of the policies in the administration’s agenda have come through the House Judiciary Committee of which I am a member and former chairman. This Congress I’ve introduced the Legal Workforce Act, which saves jobs for American workers, and the Immigration in the National Interest Act, which prioritizes skills and training and ends extended-family chain migration. “I appreciate the President promoting these policies and I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to pass needed immigration reform.” ###
10.05.2017	Washington, DC – Today Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted in support of H. Con. Res. 71, which establishes the budget for the United States government for fiscal year 2018 and sets forth budget levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027. The budget passed by a vote of 219-206. Rep. Smith: “We need to take our government’s debt seriously. With this budget, we put our economic house in order by reining in out-of-control spending. This legislation balances our budget over the next ten years and reduces the deficit, which is a drag on our economy.”
10.03.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted in support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36), which restricts abortions 20 weeks or more after fertilization. Specifically, H.R. 36 establishes criminal penalties for any person who performs or attempts an abortion on a fetus after the 20-week mark. In addition, this bill provides exceptions to save the life of the mother, and in the case of rape or incest. The legislation passed in the House 237-189. Rep. Smith: “Today I voted to protect the sanctity of life and stop the needless suffering of children whom science has showed can feel pain at 20 weeks of gestation. We need to protect vulnerable babies who have heart beats and brainwaves from the violence of abortion.” Earlier this year Congressman Smith cosponsored and the House passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act. This bill prohibits federal funding for abortions and for any insurance plan that includes abortion on demand. A long-time opponent of federal funding being used for abortions, Smith has received recognition from the National Right to Life for his pro-life record and support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
09.27.2017	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) gave the following statement today on Republicans’ Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code. Rep. Smith: “Our tax plan helps the great majority of tax payers and employers, and will create more jobs for American workers. It is simpler and fairer for families. The tax plan doubles the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. This means workers’ paychecks get more relief from federal income taxes. And the number of tax brackets is reduced to only three, down from seven. The tax rates for small and family-own businesses and corporations are also lowered. Our current corporate tax rate is the highest in the world and has caused countless companies to shift their business offshore. This tax reform encourages companies to bring their profits and jobs back to the U.S.”
09.22.2017	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith is excited to announce that Texas’ 21st Congressional District is participating in the Congressional App Challenge, an app competition for K-12 students. Congressman Lamar Smith: “We must prepare our students for degrees in STEM subjects to ensure that they have the ability to thrive in today’s technology-based economy. This means motivating more American students to study STEM subjects, including computer science. The App Challenge is a great way to get students, parents and teachers engaged and working together. I look forward to seeing the app entries from students in the 21st district.” Officially launched in 2015, this competition is a nationwide event intended to engage students’ creativity and encourage their participation in Science, Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. This competition allows students to compete with peers in their own district by creating and exhibiting their software application, or “app”, for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice. Students may compete as individuals or in teams of up to four, as long as two of the teammates are eligible to participate in our district. Students entering the competition must submit a video of their app and what they learned through this competition process on the CongressionalAppChallenge.us website by noon (EST) on November 1, 2017. The apps will be judged by a panel of local judges who work within the academic, software, and entrepreneurial fields. The app of the winning student or team in each participating Congressional district may be eligible to be featured on the U.S. House of Representatives’ website (www.house.gov), and may be eligible to be displayed in the U.S. Capitol exhibit in Washington D.C.
09.14.2017	WASHINGTON – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) introduced the Immigration in the National Interest Act (H.R. 3775), which creates a points-based merit immigration system that gives priority to immigrants who have the skills and abilities needed to contribute to our U.S. economy. The legislation is the House companion to Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and David Perdue’s (R-GA) introduction of the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act. Rep. Smith: “Our immigration system is the most generous in the world. The United States admits one million legal immigrants every year. However, less than one in six green card holders are admitted based on education and skills. “The Immigration in the National Interest Act ensures that our legal immigration system prioritizes those with the highest skills and education necessary to boost economic growth, spur innovation, and create jobs in our country. It will also reduce the number of low-skilled and under-educated immigrants. Studies have shown these individuals typically depress wages or take jobs from Americans, and receive four times as much more in government assistance than they pay in taxes. “Additionally, this bill will end the policy of automatically admitting extended relatives of legally admitted immigrants, often referred to as chain migration. Those relatives outside the nuclear family must use other methods to immigrate legally to our country. “Thank you to Senators Cotton and Perdue for their partnership on this important issue. And I appreciate President Trump’s support of this legislation and his help in fulfilling the pledge we made to make our immigration laws better serve America.” Last Thursday, Rep. Smith held a press conference announcing the introduction of this legislation and another bill to protect American workers, the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 3711). Watch the video of the press conference here.
09.08.2017	Washington, DC – Today Rep. Lamar Smith voted to provide $15 billion in emergency funding for the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to fund recovery efforts following Hurricane Harvey. The funding bill also extends the National Flood Insurance Program. Rep. Smith: “Today my vote was for all those in Texas and Louisiana who have been impacted by the devastation from Hurricane Harvey. Congress worked quickly and efficiently to pass emergency federal assistance so those affected can have the aid they need to start their recovery from Hurricane Harvey.”
09.08.2017	WASHINGTON – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) introduced the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 3711) to save jobs for citizens and legal workers by requiring U.S. employers to check the work eligibility of all future hires through the E-Verify system. Congressman Smith has a long-standing interest in E-Verify’s success; his 1996 bill created the pilot for the system. Congressman Smith was joined in introducing the bill by coauthors House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), and Congressman Ken Calvert (R-Calif.). E-Verify, operated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), checks the social security numbers of newly hired employees against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records to help ensure that they are genuinely eligible to work in the U.S. The program quickly confirms 99.8% of work-eligible employees and takes less than two minutes to use. Over 740,000 American employers currently use E-Verify and 83% of America’s employers support a mandatory electronic verification system. A summary of key components of the Legal Workforce Act can be found here. In a short video, Congressman Smith explains how to use E-Verify. Learn more about the Legal Workforce Act here and the House Judiciary Committee’s work on immigration here. On Thursday, Rep. Smith held a press conference on announcing the introduction of the legislation, and another bill he plans to introduce, the Immigration in the National Interest Act. Video of the press conference can be found here. Congressman Smith, Chairman Goodlatte, and Congressman Calvert issued the following statements today on the introduction of the Legal Workforce Act. Congressman Smith: “The Legal Workforce Act puts legal workers first and enjoys broad support from the American people. It is free, quick, easy-to-use and effective. “Nearly 20 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, seven million people are working in the United States illegally. By expanding the E-Verify system to all U.S. employers, this bill will ensure that jobs only go to legal workers. “A recent poll showed that 70 percent of voters support legislation that makes it illegal for businesses in the U.S. to hire illegal immigrants. “I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his continued commitment to this legislation and to securing our border.” Chairman Goodlatte: “The Legal Workforce Act brings our nation’s employment eligibility system into the 21st century. Rather than relying on the current paper-based I-9 system that is susceptible to fraud, this bill requires all U.S. employers to use a web-based system, E-Verify. This program takes less than two minutes to use and easily identifies whether or not a new employee is allowed to work in the United States. “Expanding E-Verify nationwide is a critical component to the interior enforcement of our immigration laws and will help maintain the integrity of our immigration system for the years ahead. I thank Congressman Smith for the many years he has worked on this important bill and look forward to the House Judiciary Committee’s consideration of it soon. ” Congressman Calvert: “Mandatory E-Verify is long overdue. The program is ready to go mandatory and the Legal Workforce Act will deliver on the promise to ensure that American jobs go to American workers and those authorized to work in the U.S. Chairman Smith and Chairman Goodlatte continue to demonstrate tremendous leadership in advancing the use of E-Verify and protecting American workers.” ###
09.07.2017	Statement by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) – As Delivered Member Press Conference on the Legal Workforce Act and Immigration in the National Interest Act Thursday, September 7, 2017, 9:30 a.m., Studio B __________________________________________________________ Immigration impacts every aspect of our society. For this reason, it is one of the most challenging issues we face as a nation. I’ve had a long-standing interest in the subject of immigration reform. When I was first elected, I represented 300 miles of the Texas-Mexico border. And I’m a former chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee and the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over immigration. I am introducing two pieces of legislation tomorrow to ensure our immigration policies put the interests of American workers and taxpayers first. The Legal Workforce Act saves jobs for American workers. It applies the E-Verify electronic employment verification system to all new hires. E-Verify is an internet-based system that compares information from an employee’s employment form with existing data at the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. The system returns a confirmation of employment eligibility or not. The Legal Workforce Act provides employers with a reliable mechanism to determine whether their new hires are authorized to work. The bill protects the rights of workers and employers by requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to issue a final determination within 10 working days of the date the employee receives a tentative non-confirmation. The average resolution time is two and a half days. The E-Verify program is free and easy to use. Employers can even access it from a smartphone. It quickly confirms 99.8 percent of work-eligible employees and takes less than two minutes to use. Over 740,000 American employers voluntarily use E-Verify today and an average of 1,500 new businesses sign up each week. One-third of American jobs are now covered by E-Verify. A recent poll found that two-thirds of voters “favor requiring businesses to use E-Verify to make sure every job goes to an American or other authorized worker.” (Pulse Opinion Research, August 25, 2017) Next, I am introducing the Immigration in the National Interest Act – the House version of Senators Cotton and Perdue’s RAISE Act. The legislation creates a new points-based merit immigration system that gives priority to immigrants who have the skills and abilities needed to contribute to our economy. Under this bill, the United States will admit five million immigrants in the next 10 years. The United States will still admit more legal permanent residents than any other country. In America today, 14% of immigrants are skilled; under this bill about 28% of immigrants admitted would be skilled. So we are doubling the percentage of skilled workers. The legislation maintains family preferences for spouses and minor children of United States residents. Other relatives of United States residents can use different visa programs to come to America, such as temporary visas, the new visa created by this bill that allows citizens to care for their parents, or the new points-based system. English language ability isn’t a requirement and thousands of immigrants will be admitted who don’t speak English. English fluency is just one of many factors that can be considered. Some immigrants will receive points for their English skills, just as they would for education or work skills. Numerous objective studies show that low-skilled immigrants depress wages or take the jobs of lower-skilled American citizens and other legal immigrants. The Heritage Foundation has determined that low-skilled immigrants cost the United States $150 billion each year. A legal immigrant without a high school degree typically receives $4 in government benefits for every $1 they pay in taxes. (Robert Rector, The Heritage Foundation – The Daily Signal, August 17, 2017.) In addition, the National Academy of Sciences estimates that a lower-skilled immigrant costs taxpayers $142,000 over the immigrant’s lifetime. Recent Polling on the provisions in the Immigration in the National Interest Act has demonstrated strong support by voters for these reforms. (Source: Pulse Opinion Research, August 25, 2017.) Over 60% of voters want an annual limit of one-half million or less for legal permanent immigrants who receive work visas. And 55% of voters support legislation that would allow immigrants to bring their spouse and minor children to the United States but would end chain migration or the automatic admission of extended family members. Also, 75% of voters say that it is important in a merit-based points system that a potential immigrant be at least moderately fluent in English These two bills put the interests of Americans first. They prevent illegal workers from taking jobs meant for Americans and prioritize our legal immigration system to admit those who can best contribute to our economy. ###
09.07.2017	WASHINGTON – On Thursday, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), held a press conference to announce the introduction of two bills to reform our legal immigration system: the Legal Workforce Act and the Immigration in National Interest Act. Rep. Smith plans to introduce the bills in the House on Friday. Rep. Smith, the sponsor of the bills, was joined at the press conference by seven members of congress who have signed on as bill cosponsors: Rep. Ken Calvert (CA-42), Rep. Steve King (IA-4), Rep. Duncan Hunter (CA-50), Rep. Buddy Carter (GA-1), Rep. Jody Hice (GA-10), Rep. Dave Brat (VA-7) and Rep. Francis Rooney (FL-19). The Legal Workforce Act discourages illegal immigration and ensures jobs are protected for American workers. It would expand the E-Verify system to cover all new employees. The Immigration in the National Interest Act is the House companion to Senators Cotton and Perdue’s legal immigration bill, the RAISE Act, which protects American workers by prioritizing immigration based on those who have the skills to succeed, expand the economy, and create jobs.

09.06.2017	Washington, DC – Today Rep. Lamar Smith voted to provide nearly $8 billion in relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana. The funding bill passed with bipartisan support. Rep. Smith: “The bill we passed today is our first step in addressing Hurricane Harvey’s devastation and our recovery needs. Members came together quickly to pass emergency assistance so those affected can have the aid they need to start getting back on their feet.”
09.05.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement today in response to Attorney General Jeff Sessions announcement on the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Rep. Smith: “Today President Trump delivered on his promise to the American people. He said he would discontinue DACA, which allows hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to stay in the country and gives them work permits. “By ending the unconstitutional DACA program he has overturned the last of the Obama Administration’s amnesty agenda and returned to the rule of law. President Obama, a former Constitutional law professor, said many times that DACA was unconstitutional. Congress and the administration should strengthen our laws against illegal immigration and ensure that our immigration policies put unemployed Americans first. The U.S. labor participation rate is at a 40 year low. “President Trump is right not to continue the DACA program and to force Congress to address immigration policies, including securing the border.”
08.02.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and David Perdue’s (R-GA) introduction of the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act. Senators Cotton and Perdue announced the introduction of legislation to reform our legal immigration system Wednesday morning with President Trump at the White House. Rep. Smith: “Each year one million legal immigrants are admitted to the United States. Our immigration system is the most generous in the world. However, our current system fails to prioritize immigration based on skills and abilities. Less than 15 percent of green card holders are admitted based on education and skills. Existing immigration policies do not prioritize the interests of American workers and taxpayers. “The RAISE Act ensures that our legal immigration system admits those with the highest training and abilities to spur economic growth and innovation. These reforms make sure that our immigration policies protect hard-working Americans. “I thank Senators Cotton and Perdue for introducing the RAISE Act. We’ve been working with the senators for months on this effort and I plan to introduce the House companion bill soon. We appreciate President Trump’s support of this legislation and his help in fulfilling the pledge we made to make our immigration laws better serve America.”
07.27.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted to provide critical funding for our national security with his support for H.R. 3219, Make America Secure Appropriations Act. The bill passed 235-192. Rep. Smith: “Today we funded multiple measures to make America more safe and secure, including funding physical barriers along our Southern border. These barriers, in combination with additional border personnel and technology, play a critical role in reducing illegal immigration. “Important to Texas’ 21st District, this legislation funds our military priorities and overhauls the way the VA does business. The bill funds a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops and ensures they have adequate training. It keeps our military on the cutting edge of defense technology with investments in updated equipment and weapons and research and development. The Dept. of Veterans Affairs is funded at its highest rate ever to support medical care for 7 million VA patients, modernize records, and reduce the disability claims backlog.”
07.25.2017	Washington, DC – On Monday evening, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) held a tele-town meeting with constituents from across the 21st Congressional District. During the event, the Congressman answered questions and took comments on a variety of issues including health care, border security and tax reform. Participants were asked four poll questions during the tele-town meeting. Results can be found below. Rep. Smith: “A majority of poll respondents voiced their disapproval of President Obama’s health care law in my telephone town meeting. We still need to replace Obamacare with a health care policy that lowers premiums, lowers taxes and makes better health care accessible to all. “I value these opportunities to hear from constituents and exchange ideas with them. Whether it’s discussing border structures or programs like E-verify, which shuts off the jobs magnet for illegal immigrants, these tele-town meetings provide a forum for me to learn how my constituents feel about many issues.” July 24, 2017 Tele-town Meeting Poll Results Do you support the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare? Yes – 22% No – 70% Undecided – 8% Do you support programs like E-verify to ensure American jobs only go to legal workers?

07.14.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted to provide critical resources for our national security with his support for The National Defense Authorization Act. The bipartisan bill passed 344-81. The 21st Congressional District is home to Joint Base San Antonio-Ft. Sam Houston and over 60,000 active duty servicemembers, veterans and their families. Congressman Smith gave the following statement on the bill. Rep. Smith: “As we know in Texas, a state where military culture runs deep, the men and women who keep us safe are our country’s most valuable asset. Congress has the responsibility to provide them the resources, care and pay raise they need, earned, and deserve. “After a decade and a half of cuts, we are providing the measures to rebuild and maintain our military. The 2.4 percent pay raise in the bill is the highest in eight years. The legislation also increases the number of troops, provides greater training opportunities, and prioritizes the restoration and modernization of our military facilities. I will continue to work for the servicemen and women who sacrifice so that all Americans can be free.” ###
06.29.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted today in support of the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate’s Law – bills that strengthen immigration enforcement and crack down on the dangerous sanctuary policies have failed the American people and cost too many lives. Rep. Smith: “These bills are a down payment on our pledge to protect innocent Americans from criminal immigrants who deserve to be jailed or sent back to their home countries. “There is absolutely no excuse for local governments to ignore immigration laws at the expense of the safety and well-being of Americans like Kate Steinle. Kate’s Law protects public safety by enhancing penalties for deported felons who return to the United States. Kate’s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminal Act keep dangerous criminal immigrants off our streets and out of our neighborhoods, a goal that should be shared by all.”
06.23.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith gave the following statement today following President Trump signing the bipartisan Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (S. 1094) into law. Rep. Smith: “President Trump is honoring his promise to hold accountable VA employees 'who let our veterans down.' The legislation signed today allows the VA Secretary more flexibility to remove, demote or suspend employees who are engaged in unprofessional behavior and not providing the quality of service our veterans deserve. It’s unfair to veterans and the vast majority of dedicated staff at Texas VA facilities when the agency doesn’t hold employees accountable.” Background: The Department of Veterans Affairs’ arcane civil service rules have allowed for months of paid leave for an employee who was involved in an armed robbery, a nurse who took part in surgery while intoxicated and a manager responsible for hospital construction delays costing over $1 billion. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 creates a more efficient and streamlined removal process for poor performing employees while still protecting due process rights and the right to appeal.
06.16.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) gave the following statement today on the Trump Administration’s decision to rescind the Obama Administration’s unconstitutional “Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents.” Rep. Smith: “The DAPA program is an unconstitutional action taken by President Obama that granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. I support the Trump Administration’s decision to rescind this illegal program and restore the rule of law.” Background compiled by the House Judiciary Committee: Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own. On November 20, 2014, President Obama announced unilateral changes to the nation’s immigration laws, allowing potentially millions of unlawful immigrants to stay in the United States without a vote of Congress. In December 2014, 26 states – led by the State of Texas – filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration. On February 17, 2015, a federal judge temporarily blocked President Obama’s unilateral immigration actions. Following this decision, Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman Smith and other Members of Congress filed an amicus brief with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in support of a continued injunction against President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration in the case of United States v. Texas. On November 10, 2015, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction preventing President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration from being implemented. Following this decision, the Supreme Court announced that it would take up the case. On March 17, 2016, the House, approved H. Res. 639, a resolution allowing the Speaker to file a brief on behalf of the whole House of Representatives defending Congress’ Article I powers to write our nation’s laws. The House filed its brief on April 4, 2016. On June 23, 2016, the Supreme Court effectively blocked President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration from being implemented for the remainder of the Obama Administration, allowing a lower court ruling to stand.
06.13.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith voted today to support The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (S. 1094). The Department of Veterans Affairs’ arcane civil service rules have allowed for months of paid leave for an employee who was involved in an armed robbery, a nurse who took part in surgery while intoxicated and a manager responsible for hospital construction delays costing over $1 billion. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 creates a more efficient and streamlined removal process for poor performing employees while still protecting due process rights and the right to appeal. Rep. Smith: “This legislation allows the VA Secretary more flexibility to remove, demote or suspend employees who are engaged in unprofessional behavior and not providing the quality of service our veterans deserve. It’s unfair to veterans and the vast majority of dedicated employees at Texas VA facilities when the agency doesn’t hold employees accountable.” In March, the House passed H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First Act of 2017. The Senate passed S. 1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 on June 6, 2017. Because the Senate accountability bill passed today in the House, it will now go to the President Trump to be signed into law.
06.08.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) gave the following statement on his vote in support of the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10), which passed in the House 233-186: Rep. Smith: “The Dodd-Frank law over-regulates the financial services sector and has permanently closed the doors of hundreds of local banks across the country. Under Dodd-Frank it has become more expensive for families to buy a home, send a child to college, plan for retirement or to start a business. “The Financial CHOICE Act removes burdens that discourage bank lending, decreases the cost of compliance, and improves access to credit. The CHOICE Act also ends Dodd-Frank’s taxpayer bailout of banks, called “Too Big To Fail.” Communities across Texas and America will be well-served by the accountability, opportunities and transparency in Chairman Hensarling’s bill.”
05.23.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) released the following statement today after the Administration released the Fiscal Year 2018 budget. Rep. Smith: “President Trump is keeping his promises to build a strong military, secure the border, cut taxes and lower deficits. The President’s plan balances budget and reins in federal spending programs that ballooned under the Obama administration.”
05.04.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Smith (R-TX) released the following statement on his support of the American Health Care Act. The legislation passed in the house by a vote of 217 to 213. Rep. Smith: “I support the American Health Care Act, which eliminates burdensome taxes and mandates, reduces costs, and makes better health care accessible to all. This legislation allows for greater choice and puts Americans back in control of their health care.”
05.03.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted against the Fiscal Year 2017 spending bill. The legislation allocates $1.07 trillion to fund the federal government through September 30, 2017. Rep. Smith: “In Congress, legislation is seldom all good or all bad. Most bills that are signed into law are a mix of the two. This spending bill was no different. “However, the negative provisions in this spending bill outweigh the positive ones. “I would have preferred a bill that reduces spending, increases immigration enforcement and border security, and promotes the priorities of the American people. The spending bill did not meet these criteria and as a result I could not support it.”
05.03.2017	Washington, DC – On Monday, Congressman Lamar Smith was presented the 2016 Award for Conservative Excellence by the American Conservative Union Foundation (ACUF) for his 92% score for his votes during the 2016 year. The average score for House Republicans was 82%. Congressman Lamar Smith said of the score, “My votes represent my constituents. I continue to stand for liberty, personal responsibility, traditional values, and a strong national defense.” For over 46 years, ACUF has rated Members of Congress and the commitment to the conservative values we share by examining their voting record. ACUF ranks 8,000 elected federal and state officeholders every year, and uses the information as an educational tool to inform the public about where there representatives stand on the issues important to them. ACUF Chairman Matt Schlapp said of the congressman’s Award for Conservative Excellence, “Chairman Smith has brought conservative leadership to several important committees in Congress and we can always rely on him to chart the conservative course. It’s our honor to give him ACU’s highest award.” ###
04.28.2017	Washington, DC – On Saturday, April 29th, President Trump will serve his 100th day in office. Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) gave the following statement on President Trump’s accomplishments since inauguration. Rep. Smith: “President Trump has had a very successful first 100 days in office. He has appointed a highly qualified cabinet, added a new Justice to the Supreme Court and rolled back more regulations than any president in history. His pro-growth policies account for consumer confidence reaching a 16-year high. “President Trump has also made dramatic steps to secure the border. He has prioritized the deportation of criminal immigrants, allocated resources to construct physical barriers along our southern border, increased the number of immigration and border personnel and cracked down on cities that provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants from federal law. As a result, illegal immigration is decreasing and our communities are safer. “We in Congress have kept up with President Trump’s rigorous pace. So far, Congress has sent 29 bills to the president’s desk that have been signed into law. Four of those 29 new laws are bills from the Science, Space and Technology Committee of which I am chairman. These include: H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act; H.R. 321, the Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators, Researchers, and Explorers (INSPIRE) Women Act; S. 442, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017; and H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act. These crucial bills will greatly help the American people and bolster our scientific and educational endeavors.”
04.27.2017	Washington, DC – On Thursday, Captain Chase Wilke of the U.S. Air Force reunited with someone he had not seen in quite a while but could never forget. In 2006, while Wilke was a student at Canyon High School, Congressman Lamar Smith nominated him to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Wilke played football at the Academy in Colorado Springs and graduated near the top of his class, earning a degree in Mechanical Engineering. He has served in the Air Force since 2011. Wilke has completed multiple tours overseas serving in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. This week he visited Washington, D.C. to meet with Rep. Smith. Captain Wilke has decided to end his active duty military service and this fall will begin business school at the University of Pennsylvania. Rep. Smith: “I have long maintained that nominating young men and women to service academies is one of the most enjoyable jobs I have. After nominating Chase 11 years ago, it is rewarding to witness his personal and professional achievements. I want to thank him for his patriotism and service to our country.”
04.07.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to U.S. military strikes in Syria: Rep. Smith: “All Americans can appreciate the President's strong leadership in responding to Syria’s government launching a chemical attack on their own people.”
04.05.2017	Washington, DC – On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-9 along party lines to move Judge Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court nomination to the full Senate chamber. Democrats have threatened to filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation, a process that enables a single senator to stop all action on a bill or a Supreme Court judicial nominee. The filibuster is only constrained by the Senate’s cloture rule, which places time limits on debate and requires a 60-vote threshold to advance legislation or a nominee to the Supreme Court. In light of the potential filibuster of Judge Gorsuch, some senators have argued in favor of the more democratic option, to lower the cloture vote threshold to a simple majority for Supreme Court confirmations – just as the Senate amended its rules in 2013 for nominees other than Supreme Court justices. Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) gave the following statement on the Judge Gorsuch confirmation process: Rep. Smith: “The Senate filibuster and the 60-vote requirement is a threat to democracy. This arcane rule has evolved from its original intent to protect individual senators’ right to debate to a partisan tactic that has paralyzed the legislative process in the United States Senate. “The will of the American people is ignored when Senate Democrats shut down votes despite a Supreme Court nominee having the support of the majority of the Senate. Senate Republicans have the responsibility to exercise the democratic option and use their 52 seat majority to confirm Judge Gorsuch.”
04.05.2017	WASHINGTON – In a speech on the House floor Tuesday evening, Rep. Lamar Smith (TX-21) spoke about the legality of surveillance of candidate and then President-elect Trump. See link to speech video and text as delivered below. Was Surveillance of Trump Illegal? Criminal laws may well have been broken when the Obama administration conducted surveillance of candidate and then President-elect Trump and those close to him, including his family members. It is reported that a former national security advisor under President Obama ordered the names of Trump associates be revealed rather than kept confidential, as would normally be the case with any American citizen. This exposing and disseminating personal information may well have been a criminal act. A serious question is, “Who authorized the surveillance in the first place?” To direct intelligence or law enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance of political opponents is a violation of the Constitution and a threat to our democracy. But the Obama administration wrongfully asked the IRS to target conservative organizations, so anything is possible. One thing is for sure – the American people need to learn a lot more about what the Obama administration did, and who did it. ###
03.30.2017	Congressman Smith speaks at the 2017 Statesmanship Dinner. WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) received the 2017 Statesmanship Award for “Empowering Tomorrow’s Technology Leaders” by the Association of Former Members of Congress (FMC). This award is bipartisan and given each year to Democrat and Republican current or former Members of Congress to recognize their distinguished Congressional service and commitment to improving the lives of others. “As Chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and Representative from the great state of Texas, Congressman Smith knows the value of educating the next generation to be leaders in a technology driven global market, said Cliff Stearns, President of the FMC and former Member of Congress. “Rep. Smith distinguishes himself as an inventive policymaker and we wholeheartedly share his dedication to promoting a bipartisan approach to the technological issues facing our world today and educating young leaders in the process.” Congressman Smith said, “I thank my colleagues and former Members of Congress for this great honor. Only by working together have we been able to pass landmark Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) legislation. “Unfortunately, America lags behind many other nations when it comes to STEM education. That’s why we’ve worked to expand the definition of STEM, encourage students to study these subjects and train more teachers. All our bills on the Committee have been designed to help young people get good jobs, contribute to the economy, and help the United States compete globally.” Every year for nearly two decades, the Annual Statesmanship Awards Dinner hosted by the Association of Former Members of Congress (FMC) has recognized outstanding individuals and organizations who exemplify courage, commitment and passion for furthering democracy, and who have demonstrated a life-long dedication to service. ### Images: Statesmanship Dinner 1 Statesmanship Dinner 2
03.29.2017	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement in response to the tragic accident in Uvalde County Texas involving a collision between a truck and a van carrying members of New Braunfels First Baptist Church returning home from a retreat. Congressman Smith: "My condolences go to the First Baptist Church and the New Braunfels community. We're grateful for the continuing work of Uvalde and Real County first responders during this tragedy."
03.28.2017	WASHINGTON – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) discussed the path to “Restoring Enforcement of our Nation’s Immigration Laws” with expert witnesses at a House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security hearing. Congressman Smith described how the high rate of crime among illegal immigrants endangers our communities. He said, “When you look at the crimes committed by illegal immigrants, you find out that for example over 35% of the individuals who are sentenced for federal crimes are illegal immigrants(1)… Well illegal immigrants are 3.5 percent of the population, so that means they are ten times more likely to be sentenced for a federal crime than legal residents. Ten times. And that’s why we say rightfully that illegal immigrants are disproportionally dangerous to innocent Americans and dangerous to our communities and dangerous to our neighborhoods.” (00:21) Congressman Smith is founder and chairman of the House Border Security Caucus. Full video of Congressman Smith’s comments at the hearing are viewable here. (1). U.S. Sentencing Commission’s Interactive Sourcebook, 2015.
03.24.2017	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement in response to the American Health Care Act being withdrawn from the legislative schedule for Friday. Congressman Smith: “Even though we did not vote on the American Health Care Act this week, I still feel we need to replace Obamacare with a health care policy that lowers premiums, lowers taxes and makes better health care accessible to all.”
03.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce honored Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) with its annual Spirit of Enterprise Award, given in recognition of his 100% score in 2016. “Businesses of all shapes and sizes need sound, commonsense policy in place in order to get off the ground, grow, and succeed,” said Thomas J. Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “The Spirit of Enterprise Award recognizes those members of Congress who have done what’s right for our friends, family, and neighbors running businesses across the country. We applaud Congressman Smith for his commitment to free enterprise and economic growth.” Congressman Smith said, “I thank the Chamber for this recognition of my past work for Texans. I look forward to the opportunity this year to enact policy that promotes economic growth and creates jobs by reducing burdensome regulations on businesses and simplifying our tax code for hard-working taxpayers.” The Chamber’s prestigious Spirit of Enterprise Award is given annually to members of Congress based on their votes on critical business legislation as outlined in the Chamber’s annual scorecard, How They Voted. Members who supported the Chamber’s position on at least 70 percent of those votes qualify to receive the award. During the second session of the 114th Congress, the Chamber scored members on 8 Senate votes and 14 House votes related to access to capital for small businesses, ensuring our workforce has the skills necessary for the jobs of tomorrow, and helping American manufacturers compete in a global economy. In addition, votes in support of building the U.S. water infrastructure system, protecting intellectual property, and updating energy policy also factored into scoring. This is the 29th year that the U.S. Chamber has formally honored the accomplishments of this select group of members of Congress. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations.
03.20.2017	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement in response to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Declined Detainer Outcome Report (DDOR). This first edition of the report includes information specifically on immigration enforcement in Travis County (Texas). Rep. Smith: “I’m glad to see that the Department of Homeland Security continues to battle sanctuary cities that violate federal law. This ensures that Americans know which cities continue to release dangerous criminal immigrants, putting innocent Americans at risk. I support the Trump Administration’s efforts to enforce laws that stop criminal immigrants from being released into the community. “Travis County officials endanger innocent Texans when they release immigrants who have been convicted of crimes that include domestic violence, aggravated assault and DUIs. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 70 percent of violent offenders are arrested for a new crime within five years of release from jail or prison. I hope the County will comply with the spirit and letter of the law to protect the safety of Travis County residents." Background: The DDOR is a weekly report that shows local jurisdictions with the highest volume of criminal immigrants released due to local governments’ refusal to cooperate with federal immigration officials to ensure that these criminals remain in custody. It includes a list of crimes associated with those released individuals. The report is mandated by the president’s executive order “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.” The report, which spans from January 28-February 3, 2017 includes nearly 150 individuals released from Travis County, part of which is included in the congressional district Congressman Smith represents. The DDOR report also details the narrow criteria Travis County uses to honor detainer requests from U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement. These include a court order or that the immigrant has a charge or conviction of Capital Murder, First Degree Murder, Aggravated Sexual Assault, or Continuous Smuggling of Persons.
03.17.2017	WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted in support of a bill that improves the Secretary of Veterans Affairs ability to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the VA (H.R. 1367). The bill passed unanimously in the House. The night before, the House passed the VA Accountability First of 2017 (H.R. 1259) which reforms the VA by giving more authority to the VA Secretary to hold employees accountable for poor performance or misconduct. A recent study completed by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that, on average, it takes six months to a year, to remove a permanent civil servant in the Federal Government. Rep. Smith: “Today Republicans and Democrats worked together to hack away at more VA bureaucracy. It’s too hard to both fire and hire employees at the VA, which keeps Veterans from receiving the care and service they deserve. This bill corrects deficiencies within VA’s overly bureaucratic and lengthy hiring process so that they can efficiently recruit and retain highly qualified doctors and professionals at all levels.”
03.16.2017	WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Lamar Smith voted in favor of two bills that support our nation’s veterans. Both passed and will go on to the Senate. The first is the VA Accountability First of 2017 (H.R. 1259) reforms the Department of Veterans Affairs by giving more authority to the VA Secretary to hold employees accountable for poor performance or misconduct. The second bill is the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 1181). Rep. Smith: “The Accountability First Act allows the VA Secretary more flexibility to remove, demote or suspend employees who are engaged in bad behavior and not performing the duties our veterans need. It’s unfair to the vast majority of honest and hardworking employees at Texas VA facilities when the agency doesn’t hold bad actors accountable. “The VA also shouldn’t be allowed to determine whether a Veteran should have to give up their second amendment rights. Those who are willing to risk their lives to protect our freedoms deserve due process; a court should make that decision.”
03.10.2017	Washington, DC – Today, legislation authored and introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to penalize lawyers for filing frivolous lawsuits passed in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction ACT (LARA) of 2017 passed by a vote of 230-188. Congressman Smith and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) gave the following statements. Congressman Smith: “Everyday attorneys file frivolous lawsuits that cost innocent Americans their livelihoods. These attorneys engage in legalized extortion and try to force individuals to settle out of court instead of paying huge court costs. There is currently no disincentive to deter attorneys from filing frivolous claims. By requiring attorneys who file junk lawsuits to pay the court costs of those they sue, such lawsuits will be discouraged. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Grassley in the Senate to get this commonsense bill to President Trump’s desk.” Chairman Goodlatte: “Lawyers who flood our federal courts with frivolous suits have no place in our civil justice system. Baseless suits brought against hardworking Americans, as well as businesses large and small, have a real cost that ultimately hurt the economy. Judges need to have the tools necessary to combat unscrupulous lawyers, and Congress is answering their calls for reform. “Our civil justice system was created to serve Americans who brings legitimate claims to court, and the reforms in LARA allow for the doors of justice to stay open, while ensuring attorneys are held accountable for filing lawsuits with no basis in law or fact.”
03.08.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted to provide critical funding for our national security with his support for H.R. 1301, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2017. The bill passed 371-48. The 21st Congressional District is home to Joint Base San Antonio-Ft. Sam Houston and over 60,000 active duty servicemembers, veterans and their families. Congressman Smith gave the following statement on the bill. Rep. Smith: “Our region supports major advances in military technology and this bill funds research and development that not only allows our country to maintain our technological advantage but also supports health research in areas including brain injuries and mental health. “To better support our soldiers, a 2.1 percent pay raise is included, along with full medical benefits for troops, military families and retirees. The legislation provides funding for a strong, robust active and reserve force. It will also ensure that the training and equipment they need to carry out their missions are available. I will continue to work for the servicemen and women who sacrifice so that all Americans can be free.”
03.07.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Smith (R-TX) released the following statement on the American Health Care Act. Rep. Smith: “The health care insurance market is in a death spiral and is in need of a quick response. Without action to fix the mess Obamacare created, premiums and deductibles would continue to go up while the quality of patient care stagnates or declines. “The two pieces of legislation we have introduced uphold our pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Our plan would eliminate Obamacare’s unpopular taxes and mandates, expand choice, improve access, and lower costs. We would ensure coverage for those with pre-existing conditions and young Americans can stay on their parents’ plan until they are 26. Our goal continues to be affordable care for all Americans. This plan take us in the right direction.”
03.06.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to President Trump’s new executive order to protect Americans from potential terrorists and criminals with stricter vetting of refugees and immigrants. Rep. Smith: “I appreciate President Trump’s continued commitment to protect innocent Americans from those who enter the United States. I support this order that places short-term limits on the admission of new refugees and temporary immigrants from six nations deemed a security threat. This policy ensures that the government has the procedures and information in place to properly vet certain foreign nationals who seek to come to our country.”
02.28.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith gave the following statement in response to President Trump’s Joint Address. Rep. Smith: “The President’s address tonight was a home run. How could anyone disagree with putting Americans first? “President Trump has taken swift action to address many of the bad policies instituted by the Obama Administration. We need policies that promote economic growth and create jobs. We must have health care reforms that expand choice, improve access and lower costs. We must secure the border to stop the flow of drugs and protect American jobs and lives. We must reaffirm our commitment to our servicemen and servicewomen – past and present – by providing them with the best resources possible. “Our work is just beginning as we continue on the path to increased economic growth and prosperity.”
02.21.2017	San Antonio – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issuing enforcement memos for the agency on implementing President Trump’s border and interior executive orders. Rep. Smith: “The American people should thank Secretary Kelly for issuing two enforcement memorandums today that overturn the dangerous immigration policies of President Obama. Secretary Kelly’s actions return the Department of Homeland Security to its central mission. “These actions prioritize the deportation of criminal immigrants, allocate resources to construct physical barriers along our southern border, and increase the number of immigration and border personnel to keep our communities safe from the scourge of illegal immigration.”
02.14.2017	San Antonio – On Sunday, March 5, at 2:00 p.m. at the University of Texas at San Antonio, the office of Congressman Lamar Smith will host an information session for Central and South Texas students, parents, counselors and educators regarding the five service academies: the United States Military Academy, the United States Merchant Marine Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United States Coast Guard Academy and the United States Air Force Academy.

02.02.2017	Washington, DC – Today, legislation authored and introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to penalize lawyers for filing baseless lawsuits passed in the House Judiciary Committee. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction ACT (LARA) of 2017 passed by a vote of 17-6. Chairman Smith: “Every day, innocent Americans face the scourge of frivolous lawsuits. Their reputations and livelihoods are jeopardized by attorneys who have everything to gain and nothing to lose by filing baseless lawsuits. LARA fights this legalized extortion. I look forward to working with Chairman Goodlatte and Senator Grassley to get this commonsense bill to President Trump’s desk.”
01.31.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States. Rep. Smith: “President Trump has long spoken of his conservative vision for our country’s next Supreme Court Justice being in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. Last November, the American people decided what type of Justice they wanted to fill the vacancy on the Court. President Trump made it clear that he would nominate a jurist who would interpret and defend the Constitution as intended by our Founders. He has done just that by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch.” ###
01.30.2017	Washington, D.C. – Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas, the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation today to reduce frivolous lawsuits that bog down the United States legal system and cost businesses billions of dollars every year. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (LARA) would impose mandatory sanctions for lawyers who file meritless suits in federal court. Federal rules requiring sanctions for frivolous suits were watered down in 1993, which resulted in increased lawsuit abuse. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores the mandatory sanctions which hold attorneys accountable for lawsuit abuse. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia is an original cosponsor of the bill. “The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act is just over one-page long but it would prevent the filing of thousands of frivolous lawsuits in federal court. Lawsuits have been filed against the Weather Channel for failing to accurately predict storms, against television shows people claimed were too scary, and against fast-food companies because inactive children gained weight. These types of absurd cases wrongly cost innocent individuals and business owners their reputations and their livelihoods. LARA requires lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits to pay the attorneys’ fees and court costs of innocent defendants. I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley to get this common sense bill to President Trump’s desk,” Smith said. “Our American legal system is designed to be a tool for justice, and justice delayed is justice denied. However, too many baseless claims, often filed by unscrupulous lawyers, are clogging our legal system, increasing costs and delaying swift resolution of genuine legal grievances. Targets of frivolous lawsuits, often small businesses, are also burdened with unnecessary legal expenses. This bill helps to rebalance the scales of justice by weeding our legal system of frivolous claims and deterring lawyers from engaging in abusive and meritless litigation practices,” Grassley said. “Lawsuits are complicated, but this bill is simple. Thousands of frivolous lawsuits have no place in our legal system, and the true victims are often small businesses or individuals who cannot afford to fight these claims. Members of both the House and Senate have been trying to make our legal system work properly for the American people for years, and now we are taking action to get truly meaningless lawsuits out of our courts,” Goodlatte said. Every year, billions of dollars are wasted on frivolous lawsuits, forcing individuals and businesses to spend thousands of dollars on litigation. This ultimately costs jobs and damages the economy because money that could be spent hiring new employees or investing in new businesses is instead directed toward legal fees. The annual direct cost of American tort litigation has been estimated at more than $250 billion. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to the U.S. legal system by providing penalties for filing baseless, meritless and frivolous lawsuits. Specifically, the bill: Reinstates sanctions for the violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which was originally intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party. Ensures that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits, including the attorney’s fees and costs incurred by the victim of the frivolous lawsuit. Reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow parties and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims by withdrawing them within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been served. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act is also cosponsored by Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and representatives Steve Chabot (R-OH), chairman of the House Small Business Committee, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Trent Franks (R-AZ.), Blake Farenthold (R-TX) and Ken Buck (R-CO). A copy of the bill can be found here. ###
01.30.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to President Trump’s executive order which aims to protect Americans from potential terrorists with stricter vetting of refugees and immigrants coming from terrorism-sponsoring countries. Rep. Smith: “I appreciate President Trump’s effort to protect innocent Americans from those who enter the United States to do us harm. We ought to take every reasonable step possible to protect the American people from terrorism. Two years ago, President Obama designated these seven countries as a security threat for travel purposes. These countries were designated based on the threat of terrorism, not religion or any other factor. Those from terrorist sponsoring countries should not be admitted until they can be properly vetted by our national security agencies. “This action is temporary. The regular process will resume once security policies are updated over the next 90 days. That is what President Trump’s action does.”
01.25.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement today in response to President Donald Trump signing executive orders to enhance border security, provide the necessary personnel and resources to enforce immigration laws, and compel sanctuary cities to comply with the law. Rep. Smith: “Less than a week after President Trump took office he is honoring his commitment to secure the border. Close to half a million illegal immigrants cross our borders every year. They take jobs away from American workers and reduce the wages of other American workers. They often use government services, which costs American taxpayers. I have long supported efforts to secure our borders and appreciate the President’s efforts to do so.”
01.24.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted in support of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act (H.R. 7) which passed in the House 238-183. Rep. Smith: “Americans’ tax dollars shouldn’t fund abortions, but under Obamacare that tragedy occurs. In 2014, taxpayer dollars went toward over 1,000 Obamacare health care plans that included abortion, despite President Obama’s promise that Obamacare would not cover abortion. “H.R. 7 prohibits funds authorized or appropriated by federal law to support any abortion. I urge the Senate to approve this important legislation to save countless more lives.”
01.11.2017	Washington, DC – Today the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “Regulatory Accountability Act” to provide relief to hardworking Americans by putting strong checks and balances on regulations from the executive branch. Federal regulations impose a nearly $2 trillion burden on Americans, which equates to roughly $15,000 per household. Costs and time spent on regulatory compliance weigh heavy on small businesses. Regulations created under the Obama administration were responsible for over 194 million hours spent on paperwork. These excessive mandates discourage innovators from starting new businesses and investing in existing ones. The Regulatory Accountability Act includes six separate bills that have previously passed the house to reduce the costs imposed by regulations, require more transparency and time for public comment, evaluate less costly alternatives, and account for the impact regulations have on small businesses. Congressman Smith wrote the original Regulatory Accountability Act in 2011 as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Smith: “When regulators create new rules, the often fail to analyze the full effects. This bill helps reduce the impact of heavy handed regulations on Americans and frees up time and resources for job creation. I look forward to working with President-Elect Trump and the Senate to continue to rein in regulations that hamper our economic growth.”
01.05.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith voted in support of H. Res. 11, which rejects the recent anti-Israel United Nations resolution. The House adopted the opposition measure by a vote of 342 to 80. The UN resolution condemned some Israeli settlements and called for immediate halt to further development. The Obama administration had the opportunity to veto the dangerous and counterproductive resolution in December but did not. Rep. Smith: “It is regrettable that the Obama Administration abstained from vetoing the anti-Israel United Nations Security Council Resolution last month. This inaction significantly undermines the peace process. It fails to hold the Palestinian Authority accountable while simultaneously condemning Israel. “I am happy to support this effort and am encouraged that the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 11. We must reaffirm our steadfast support of Israel, one of our oldest and strongest allies. And continue to support direct, bilateral peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine.” ###
01.03.2017	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith voted to pass H.Res. 5 to adopt the rules for the 115th Congress. The Rules Package did not include any changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE). The OCE’s independence and authority will remain unaltered. Rep. Smith: “Today marks the start to a new year full of opportunity. The rules we voted on today will govern all members of Congress as we take the votes this year that move us toward a safer, stronger and more prosperous nation. We should be held to the highest ethical standard as we represent the American people in Congress.” ###
12.14.2016	WASHINGTON – House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after President-elect Donald J. Trump announced former Texas Governor Rick Perry will lead the Department of Energy. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “Rick Perry is an excellent choice to lead our nation’s Energy Department. He is a champion of energy development. As a former governor of Texas, Rick Perry has in-depth experience running a state with an economy that ranks 11th in the world. Texas is an ‘all of the above’ energy state and is the largest producer of oil and gas in the country as well as the largest producer of wind energy. The Science Committee that I chair has jurisdiction over the Energy Department’s research and development budget of $10 billion. I look forward to working with the former governor and the Trump administration to develop less costly energy for the American people and to advance the Department’s core scientific missions.” ### Statement is also viewable on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee website here.
12.02.2016	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) released the following statement after the House passed the conference report to the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Article 1 Section VIII of the Constitution states the Congress is charged with providing for the common defense of the United States. Each year an updated bill is voted on to authorize what’s needed for a national defense best suited to protect and defend our country. Rep. Smith: “Today the House took action on a bill that allows for the highest pay raise for our troops in six years. "While serving our country, service members need the ability to train for and execute their missions without being limited by an arbitrary lack of resources. In addition to increasing personnel, this bill provides the means to improve readiness and maintenance so troops can do their jobs safely and effectively. "We also voted to strengthen military health care – ensuring no TRICARE increases for those currently serving and requiring full disclosure for any changes for those that join the military in the future. "The bill keeps Guantanamo Bay open and prohibits transferring Guantanamo detainees to American soil. It also improves our ability to fight ISIS through counterterrorism and prioritizes strong cybersecurity defense.” ###
10.28.2016	WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the U.S. House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, today released the following statement following the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) announcement that it has reopened its investigation of the use of an insecure, private email server to conduct official business by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “A smoking gun has long been evident in the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email server, and the decision to reopen the investigation is a step in the right direction to determine who pulled the trigger. On September 28 at a Congressional hearing, I called on FBI Director Comey to reopen the FBI’s investigation into former Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server because of the many unanswered questions that remained after its initial inquiry closed. Today’s news that the FBI has discovered new information that has led it to determine that its investigation is incomplete and requires additional review by FBI investigators is a welcome and overdue development. “Throughout the investigation of the security of former Secretary Clinton’s private server, the committee’s inquiries have been met with resistance and obstruction by companies and organizations associated with former Secretary Clinton. Given this reasoning, I recently announced that the committee intends to hold her private server company, Platte River Networks, in contempt of Congress. “The American people deserve a transparent government and the assurance that our nation’s security will not be jeopardized. I look forward to continuing the committee’s investigation into the security of former Secretary Clinton’s private email server.” Background On Oct. 20, Smith announced plans to hold the company that set up and maintained former Secretary Clinton’s private server, Platte River Networks, in contempt of Congress. At a Sept. 28 House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Smith urged FBI Director James Comey to reopen the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server. On Sept. 20, Rep. Smith issued a subpoena to FBI Director Comey for documents and information related to the security of Clinton’s private email account and server. The Committee requested these documents in a Sept. 9 letter. Director Comey has failed to produce any documents pursuant to the previous request. On Aug. 22, Smith issued subpoenas to the three companies who maintain former Secretary Clinton’s private server with the support of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, after the companies failed to comply with the Science Committee’s voluntary request for documents and interviews. Smith’s subpoenas built on July 12 bicameral efforts to request information and earlier investigations initiated separately by Chairman Smith and Chairman Johnson. The Science Committee has jurisdiction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which sets standards pursuant to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA).

10.27.2016	WASHINGTON – This week Congressman Smith was recognized by the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) for having a strong voting record on lowering taxes and limiting government. Rep. Smith is one of the few members on Capitol Hill whose votes during the past legislative session are worthy of the “Taxpayers’ Friend Award” for 2015. Rep. Smith said of the award: “Americans deserve a fairer, simpler tax system and our economy needs tax relief. The best way to refuel the economy and keep Texas competitive and growing is to reduce taxes. I will continue to support policies that reduce the tax burden on Americans and reign in the government’s spending.” NTU has recognized Representatives and Senators since 1979 whose voting record deems them a “Taxpayers’ Friend.” Only 14 Senate and 43 House Members won the award for 2015. Every roll call vote in Congress affecting fiscal policy is analyzed by NTU and the “Taxpayer Score” is based on how each Member of Congress has stood up for controlling federal spending, taxes, debt and regulations. In 2015, NTU’s scorecard looked at 141 Senate and 267 House votes. Pete Sepp, President of NTU commented, “Winning the Taxpayers’ Friend Award is no easy feat. It takes a daily commitment to cast principled votes that put the Americans who pay government’s bills first. Congressman Smith has proven he has what it takes to help make Washington work for taxpayers again.” “Rep. Smith’s pro- taxpayer A rating was one of the best on all of Capitol Hill. Through his consistent voting record, Smith showed his colleagues the way to lower deficits, less burdensome taxes, and a stronger economy. If every Member of Congress had voted as conscientiously as the Congressman did last year, taxpayers could have looked forward to a much more prosperous future,” Sepp concluded. ###
09.28.2016	WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the U.S. House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, today urged FBI Director James Comey to reopen the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server. At today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing titled Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Rep. Smith questioned Director Comey and described several recent developments that would justify a reopening of the investigation, including: Reports that an employee at a company that managed former Secretary Clinton’s private email server said on the forum Reddit.com, “ . . . I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived emails….” This same employee called a new retention policy designed to delete emails after 60 days a “Hillary cover-up operation.” A former Clinton Foundation employee who also managed the Clinton server destroyed devices used by Clinton by smashing them with a hammer. Two employees involved in maintaining the Clinton server recently pleading the Fifth Amendment to Congress to avoid self-incrimination. Rep. Smith also urged Director Comey to ensure that the FBI complied with the Science Committee’s recent subpoena of documents related to the server.

09.22.2016	WASHINGTON – On Thursday evening, Congressman Lamar Smith voted in support of Prohibiting Future Ransom Payments to Iran Act (H.R. 5931) of which he is a cosponsor. Congressman Smith: “Earlier this year, the Obama administration made an undisclosed $400 million cash payment to Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism. President Obama again bypassed Congress and secretly financed our enemies, who might well use the funds for terrorist activity.” H.R. 5931 prohibits the United States Government from making any cash payments to the Government of Iran until the President certifies Iran is not a primary money laundering concern or a state sponsor of terrorism. The bill states that the policy of the United States Government is not to pay ransom or release prisoners for the purpose of securing the release of United States citizens taken hostage abroad. ###
09.22.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Lamar Smith, member and former chairman of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, delivered the following statement today at the hearing “Oversight of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” Agency director Sarah Saldaña testified at the hearing. Statement Video As delivered: I am going to use my question time to make a statement because after eight years of asking Obama Administration officials why they refuse to enforce our immigration laws, I am confident that the Committee still won’t receive satisfactory answers today. The president’s immigration policies continue to put innocent Americans at risk. The administration has ignored laws, failed to enforce laws, undermined laws, and unconstitutionally changed immigration laws. Among these dangerous policies is the president’s unconstitutional executive amnesty, which requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to release criminal immigrants into our neighborhoods where inevitably they commit additional crimes. Over the last three years, ICE has released 86,000 criminal immigrants into our communities. They had been convicted of over 230,000 crimes, which include homicide, aggravated assault, sexual assault, kidnapping, driving under the influence, and other serious crimes. Over 30 percent will be arrested again for killing or injuring more innocent Americans. The administration’s intentional release of criminal immigrants amounts to the largest jailbreak in American history. And every day Americans across the country are paying a steep price. Last year ICE deported a total of 235,000 illegal immigrants, the lowest number in ten years. This was only 2 percent of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. Of these, only about 70,000 were interior removals. Under the current administration, ICE has started counting turnbacks at the border as traditional interior removals in an attempt to pad their deportation numbers. Previous presidents did not count turnbacks as deportations. But then no president has done so little to enforce immigration laws. Investigation of immigrants who overstay their visas has disappeared. At least 40 percent of the more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the country entered legally and overstayed their visas. Yet ICE only deported 2,456 visa overstayers in 2015. That is less than one-tenth of one percent of the total number of visa overstayers. In addition, the administration has done nothing to hold any of the three hundred sanctuary cities accountable. These local governments violate federal law when they refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in the apprehension and deportation of illegal immigrants. Congress mandated the cooperation of local officials in an immigration enforcement bill in 1996. I know, I wrote the law. Tragically, the number of sanctuary cities has exploded under the Obama Administration. During testimony at our last oversight hearing, Director Saldana couldn’t name a single instance in which ICE tried to prevent a jurisdiction from becoming a sanctuary for criminal immigrants. The lawlessness of these sanctuary jurisdictions has had disastrous consequences. Last year Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a five times deported career felon, shot and killed Kathryn Steinle. Lopez-Sanchez was set free to prey on innocent Americans, like Ms. Steinle, because of San Francisco’s sanctuary law. Unfortunately, similar tragedies have occurred across the country as a result of these laws. So add these casualties to the current list of Americans who have become victims because of President Obama’s immigration policies. These facts and figures demonstrate that enforcement of our immigration laws runs contrary to the Obama Administration’s amnesty agenda. Until the immigration policies of this administration are overturned, illegal immigrants will continue to victimize innocent Americans. ###
09.16.2016	WASHINGTON – On the fifth anniversary of its enactment, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) celebrated the achievements of the America Invents Act. Spearheaded by Smith and Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the legislation passed in 2011 at a time when the country’s patent system was long overdue for reform. The patent system had served Americans well for years, but by 2005 it needed to be modernized to apply to computers, smartphones, and software. The laws could no longer protect unanticipated inventions. Patent ownership was in question. And overly broad patents were awarded that shouldn’t have been granted in the first place. The outdated system was dragged down by frivolous and costly lawsuits. Hundreds of thousands of patent applications were backlogged at the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). For six years Smith championed the need for comprehensive improvement to patent law, working across the aisle in the House of Representatives and with the Senate to make changes all could agree on. On September 16, 2011, the America Invents Act (AIA) was signed into law by President Obama. The AIA made the first comprehensive reforms to the patent system in 60 years. Since its implementation, the reforms have aided the PTO and have helped improve the quality of patents. The new law has helped the PTO reduce the backlog of patent applications, created a post-grant review system to eliminate questionable patents that have already been issued, and reformed court procedures to limit abusive patent litigation. Updates to patent laws have also harmonized the U.S. system with the global patent framework, which helps smaller inventors compete on a worldwide scale. The AIA also established satellite offices of the Patent and Trademark Office, including an office in Dallas, to more closely connect patent filers with the USPTO, and improve the speed and quality of patent examination. Congressman Smith: “Today’s anniversary marks an important date for the American patent system. The America Invents Act continues to improve the quality of patents, reduce patent application backlogs, and provide a better alternative to costly and prolonged litigation over the validity of existing patents. Congress, the Patent and Trademark Office, and stakeholders should remain committed to the America Invents Act’s continued success to unleash American innovations.” ###
09.14.2016	WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Lamar Smith and House Republicans voted to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs by giving more authority to the VA Secretary to hold employees accountable for poor performance or misconduct. By a vote of 250-171, the VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act of 2016 (H.R. 5620) passed in the House and will go on to the Senate. Congressman Smith: “Under existing law, it’s nearly impossible to replace employees at federal agencies like the VA, no matter how bad their behavior or work product. This bill takes a positive step forward by allowing the VA Secretary more flexibility to remove employees. The VA should not employ individuals who falsify records and ignore the needs of Veterans.” ###
07.15.2016	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) released the following statement after the Thursday night attack in Nice, France: “Yesterday evening the world saw again senseless loss of life – this time in Nice, France, including two Central Texans. "We’re still learning details but this tragedy shows once more that terror has no weapon of choice. We must unite together to eliminate this scourge of evil. Today Nice and the community of Lakeway, TX, will be in our prayers.”
07.13.2016	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted in support of The Conscience Protection Act (S. 304), which protects health care providers who decline to participate in abortions as a matter of conscience. The bill passed in the House 245-182. Congressman Smith: “My vote today was for common sense – no health care provider should be forced to violate their conscience to fund, support or perform abortions. The bill also rightly maintains that federal funding – Americans’ tax dollars – should be denied to any entity that discriminates against individual providers who morally object to abortion services.” ###
07.08.2016	WASHINGTON – Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement after the horrific shooting of police officers in Dallas on Thursday evening: Congressman Smith: “I am deeply saddened by the orchestrated attack on Dallas police officers who devoted their lives to serving and protecting their community. There has been a tragic loss of life this week. In this heartbreaking time, we should all join together to pray for Dallas and our nation.” ###
07.07.2016	WASHINGTON – Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement after FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s recommendation not to prosecute former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for maintaining classified information on a private server: Congressman Smith: “On Tuesday, FBI Director Comey stated that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was “extremely careless” and mishandled classified information. Director Comey’s testimony today further indicates that Clinton may have lied to Congress and likely broke the law. The decision not to prosecute sets a dangerous precedent that public officials are above the law. We cannot hold elected officials to different standards than the rest of Americans when it comes to following the law.” ###
07.06.2016	WASHINGTON – Today, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) spoke on the House floor about reports demonstrating federal immigration laws are not being enforced. One report found that the administration refuses to send many criminal immigrants back to their country of origin, and as result, thousands of dangerous immigrants are released into American neighborhoods. These reports come at a critical time, as today the Senate split 53-44 on the “Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act,” not reaching the necessary 60 senators to hold a vote on the Senate floor. Congressman Smith is the author of existing federal law that prohibits sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that refuse to share information about criminal aliens with the federal government and refuse to recognize ICE requests. The Senate bill enforces the Smith ban on sanctuary cities by denying certain federal funds to those jurisdictions that aren’t following the law. Smith said of sanctuary cities: “Federal immigration law must be enforced. State and local jurisdictions with policies that obstruct the enforcement of the law, putting Americans at risk, should be held accountable.” Watch Rep. Smith’s floor speech here. “Immigration Policies Hurt Americans” (As delivered on Wednesday, July 6, 2016) Two recent reports demonstrate the degree to which federal immigration laws are not enforced by this administration. A new study by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that almost one million illegal immigrants have been ordered deported but remain in the country. The administration doesn’t seem to care. A second report found that the administration refuses to take the steps necessary to send criminal immigrants back to their countries of origin. As a result, thousands of dangerous criminal immigrants are released into our neighborhoods. One-third commit additional crimes, including murder and sexual assault, against innocent Americans. Our borders are not secure. One-half million people come into the U.S. illegally every year. But the administration, instead of enforcing laws, wants to give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. The immigration policies of this administration continue to hurt Americans. ### Congressman Smith represents the 21st District of Texas. He serves as chairman of the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee, is also a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and is a former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
06.27.2016	WASHINGTON – Today, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) gave the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 5-3 vote to strike down a Texas law (H.B. 2) designed to provide essential protections for the health and safety of women inside the state’s abortion facilities. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Today, the Supreme Court ruled against life, common-sense safety measures and states’ rights. The court has encroached on the State of Texas’ ability to self-govern. And the court’s decision jeopardizes the safety of women who pursue abortion services. “The Supreme Court chose to side with pro-abortion advocates at the expense of an individual’s health care needs. I remain steadfast in my belief that life is precious, and no life is more vulnerable than that of an unborn child.” Earlier this year, Smith and U.S. Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and John Cornyn (R-TX), along with U.S. Representatives Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) and Pete Olson (R-TX), led a broad Congressional coalition filing an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of Texas HB 2.
06.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement in response to the Supreme Court’s 4-4 decision in United States v. Texas, which upholds the lower court’s decision that the president’s use of executive action to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants is unlawful: Congressman Smith: “The Supreme Court’s decision today in their ruling on the United States v. Texas rightfully upheld the Constitution. The president’s executive amnesty for illegal immigrants is unconstitutional. Congress has the sole authority under the Constitution to write immigration laws, not Barack Obama. His unlawful amnesty agenda to prevent the deportation of illegal immigrants and to grant them work authorization is contrary to the law and hurts unemployed Americans.” Smith has vocally supported the Texas-led, 26 state lawsuit since it was first filed in December 2014. Smith joined a brief in support of the Texas lawsuit with Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). More than a hundred members of the House and Senate supported that brief. ###
06.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following the early Sunday morning terror attack on an Orlando nightclub in which 50 people were killed and 53 more wounded, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) released the following statement: Congressman Smith: “Another radical Muslim extremist who pledged his allegiance to ISIS has targeted Americans and our way of life. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and the Orlando community. “This senseless tragedy, the worst terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11, will not intimidate us. We must fight back against terrorism. Terrorism has no one weapon of choice or method of collaboration. The U.S. must use every possible means we have to prevail over extremists.”
06.09.2016	Washington, DC – On Thursday, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) joined his Texas colleagues in Congress by sending a letter to President Obama requesting a Presidential Disaster Declaration for Travis and 11 other Texas counties in light of the recent severe weather and flooding. The letter adds further support to Governor Abbott’s request for Individual Assistance, Public Assistance (Categories A and B including Direct Federal Assistance) and Hazard Mitigation Statewide. Senators Cornyn and Cruz also wrote to the president for a disaster declaration. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Central Texas has been significantly affected by flood waters and storms that took lives and destroyed homes, roads, bridges and businesses. “Residents, emergency responders, local governments and volunteer agencies have made a tremendous impact with their response, but the continued recovery won’t be easy. I ask the president for quick consideration and approval of Governor Abbott’s disaster declaration request.” ### 6.9.16_TX Floods (POTUS Req).pdf
06.09.2016	Washington, DC – Today Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted against H.R. 5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which creates a board of managers to address the fiscal condition of Puerto Rico. Smith opposed the legislation because the bill fails to hold Puerto Rican officials accountable for their policies that caused the financial crisis and it lacks reforms to improve their fiscal state. Congressman Lamar Smith gave the following statement for the Congressional Record: “House Resolution 5278 creates a board of managers to address the fiscal condition of Puerto Rico. “However, Puerto Rican officials still have not been held accountable or accepted responsibility for their policies that caused the financial crisis. In fact, just the opposite: the Puerto Rican government ignored its fiscal obligations when it recently voted to approve a moratorium on repaying any of its debt. “But it is Puerto Rico and not Congress who should take the first steps to adopt reform measures. “There is no certainty that a financial oversight board would implement any economic growth measures to improve the Island’s fiscal condition. “The board has no mandate from Congress to address the bloated government workforce, high taxes, an insolvent pension system, limitations on trade under the Jones Act, and excessive welfare benefits, all of which helped cause the fiscal crisis. “This legislation rewards bad behavior and represents a missed opportunity for Congress to insist on fiscally responsible reforms.” ###
06.03.2016	Washington, DC – On Thursday, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) and Congresswoman Susan Brooks (IN-5) sent a letter to House appropriators urging them to prioritize support for K-12 computer science education. The letter, signed by Smith, Brooks and 22 of their colleagues on both sides of the aisle, notes how only one in four K-12 schools in the U.S. teach rigorous computer science courses. States and school districts understand the need to improve and are leading the way, investing their limited resources in computer science education. By prioritizing support for computer science education at the federal level, Congress can contribute to improving our country’s competitiveness, addressing national security and cyber defense concerns, and creating more jobs for our local communities. As Chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, Rep. Smith championed the STEM Education Act. This bill, which has been signed into law, adds computer science to the definition of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and strengthens ongoing STEM education efforts supported by the National Science Foundation. Congressman Lamar Smith: "I’ve heard from countless employers that there are not enough applicants with the technical skills they need to fill the positions they’re looking for. We need to equip our country’s students and teachers with the resources needed to succeed in the 21st century." Congresswoman Brooks: “As a former community college administrator, I understand the importance of providing our kids with the skills that will help them succeed in college and throughout their career,” Brooks said. “To maintain our nation’s competitive edge, America must raise a new generation of innovators ready to meet the demands of a global and tech-driven economy. Computing plays a crucial role in aligning our current educational attainment gap and opportunities in the workforce, and we must prioritize computer science education for students of all ages.” In April, a bipartisan group CEOs, of governors, and education leaders wrote to Congress asking for every student in every school to have an opportunity to learn computer science. The House Appropriations Committee will be weighing computer science funding in this year’s Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill. Other signers of Rep. Smith and Brooks’ computer science letter include representatives: Robert J. Dold Randy Hultgren Bruce Westerman Michael T. McCaul Elizabeth Esty Alan Grayson Barbara Comstock Blake Farenthold Eric Swalwell Steve Knight F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. Lynn Jenkins Marc A. Veasey Rick Crawford John R.

05.25.2016	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that he has received the “Hero of Main Street” award from the National Retail Federation for his support of legislation critical to the retail industry. Smith is part of a bi-partisan group honored for their support of a wide range of issues including infrastructure investment, tax reform and labor issues. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I am humbled to receive this award and thank the NRF for the honor. The true heroes of this country are main street companies and their employees. I pledge to continue supporting policies that will create jobs and economic opportunities for these businesses in Texas and around the country.” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay: “Congressman Smith has shown through his support that he cares about retailers big and small, and values the role these businesses play in communities across the country. Smith is an advocate for his thriving Main Street and to the long-term growth the retail industry -- our nation’s largest job creators and the catalyst for continued growth and opportunity for our nation’s economy.” The Hero of Main Street award was created by NRF in 2013 to recognize members of Congress for support of the retail industry’s public policy priorities. Eligibility is based on NRF’s Retail Opportunity Index, bill sponsorship and advocacy to advance the industry’s priorities. The “heroes” have supported policies and initiatives defined by NRF that recognize the contributions of the retail industry, and have worked to encourage a “vibrant, sustained and healthy” retail sector. ###
05.25.2016	Washington, DC – Today it was announced authorization has been given to begin construction on a new federal courthouse in San Antonio for the Western District of Texas. After years of efforts to replace the current, aging John H. Wood, Jr. Federal Courthouse, the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved a project prospectus for the new courthouse. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I and the other members of the San Antonio delegation, our Senators, Mayor Taylor and city and county officials have worked for many years for a new San Antonio Courthouse. I’ve pushed legislation, met with numerous government officials, and sent many letters to highlight the need for those who use the courthouse facilities to be in a safe environment. “We’re one step closer to the finish line. We now have the funds and the approval to begin work on a safe and modernized courthouse that will serve San Antonio and Western District of Texas for many years to come.” ###
05.24.2016	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and a bipartisan group of Texas members of Congress sent a letter to the Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx in support of the City of Austin’s application for the Beyond Traffic: The Smart City Challenge Grant. Smith was joined by Rep. John Carter, Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, Rep. Roger Williams and Rep. Bill Flores and Rep. Blake Farenthold, in writing to express how awarding Austin the grant will allow the city to modernize and improve its transportation system to accommodate the needs of its growing population Congressman Lamar Smith: “The City of Austin has the innovative spirit and technology expertise needed to create 21st century mobility solutions to solve real-world problems. “By improving its transportation methods, the City will give its citizens the means to safer, cheaper and cleaner travel. And it will serve as a model for other cities to develop modern, efficient transportation systems.” ### 052416 Austin Smart City Challenge LOS.pdf
05.20.2016	Washington, DC – On Thursday, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and a bipartisan group of Texas members of Congress sent a letter to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald requesting answers and action on reports of scheduling wait time manipulation at VA facilities in Austin, San Antonio and Temple. Smith was joined by Rep. Lloyd Doggett, Rep. Bill Flores, Rep. Henry Cuellar, Rep. Roger Williams and Rep. Joaquin Castro, in writing to express their ongoing concern with the state of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the affect it has on Texas Veterans. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Providing timely health care is a non-partisan issue and the VA is simply not meeting our veterans’ needs. Now more than ever, the VA and its employees must make changes to assure that the men and women who served our nation are provided timely access to health care. “On behalf of the Veterans we represent, we ask that these revelations convince VA leadership to make meaningful progress in developing a comprehensive scheduling policy so that all Veterans can receive the care they deserve.” ### 05192016 signed TX letter on VA scheduling issues.pdf
05.19.2016	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to the Library of Congress on their misguided decision to eliminate the terms “illegal aliens” and “alien” from subject heading and search classifications. Smith was joined by Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Congressman John Culberson (R-Texas) urging the Library to immediately revoke the subject heading cancellations.Congressman Lamar Smith: “The decision by the Library of Congress to eliminate the terms “illegal alien” and “alien” wrongly puts political correctness above the rule law. “These terms are legal terms of art that have been enacted into law by Congress. If individuals want to revise terms in the United States Code, they can only do so by passing legislation.” ###
05.18.2016	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017, which passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 277-147. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Congress has a responsibility to make sure our men and women in uniform are equipped with the resources needed to defend our nation. I’m particularly pleased that they’re receiving a well-deserved 2.1 % raise.” The bill boosts funding for military bases by $18 billion more than the president’s budget request. It also authorizes the necessary force, structure, equipment, and funding to help close the military readiness gap. The national defense bill ensures that the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility remains open and maintains the policy that terrorists cannot be transferred to U.S. soil. Rep. Smith opposes closure of the detention facility. In April, Rep. Smith sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter raising national security concerns over the transfer of dangerous terrorists as a result of the proposed closure. ###
05.12.2016	Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) released the following statement after a U.S. District Court sided with congressional Republicans who have challenged the implementation of Obamacare. Rep. Lamar Smith: “Today, U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary M. Collyer sided with House Republicans and ruled that the Obama Administration has been improperly funding an Obamacare insurance subsidy program. The U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell ruling states that billions of dollars have been illegally used to reimburse health insurance companies. “The power of the purse belongs to the House of Representatives, not the President. And today’s ruling has made clear that it is unconstitutional for the Obama Administration to attempt to sustain its unaffordable, unworkable health care law without legislative approval. I am encouraged by Judge Collyer’s decision and maintain that this law should be vacated and repealed, which I have voted to do over 60 times.”
05.11.2016	Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) today spoke at a news conference with Senators Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and David Vitter (R-LA), former director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the President of the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, the FBI Agents Association, and the National Sheriffs’ Association to stress why Congress should not shorten prison sentences for dangerous criminals. Rep. Lamar Smith: “Congress should be very wary of reducing federal prison sentences. The lives and property of innocent Americans are at stake. “Regrettably, the debate over sentencing laws has focused on the criminals. What about their victims? What about the dangers of putting these offenders back on the streets where three-quarters will commit new crimes against law-abiding citizens? “The size of the prison population is often cited as a justification for lowering federal sentences. But federal prisoners make up only 13% of the total prison population, which is at a ten year low and is less than one-half of 1% of the United States population. So what’s the pressing need to open the cell doors? “The downward trend in crime rates is due, at least in part, to the mandatory minimum prison terms set in the 1980s. Why push for a massive prison break when the penalties are working? Too many nonviolent offenders are incarcerated for too long, we hear, especially for drug crimes. Yet federal minimum sentences are rarely applied to low-level offenders. And over 99% of federal inmates incarcerated for drug crimes are traffickers, not simple drug possessors. “Federal convictions as a result of plea bargains, which reduce the severity of the charge in exchange for an admission of guilt, are above 90%. Why give criminals another way to reduce their sentences? “Some cite Texas’ experience in reducing sentences as an example. But in my state the overwhelming majority of prisoners, unlike federal inmates, are nonviolent offenders. They are not dangerous drug traffickers. And Texas’ recidivism rates still are significant despite their efforts. “Criminal law should punish bad behavior, deter criminal acts, and protect the American people. Releasing prisoners before their sentences are served undermines these goals and guarantees more innocent victims.”
03.22.2016	Washington, DC— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in response to the terrorist attacks in Brussels this morning. Congressman Lamar Smith: “We mourn with the people of Brussels and we strengthen our resolve to stand boldly with them against the forces of evil responsible for these acts of terrorism.”
03.17.2016	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) delivered the following remarks on the House floor in support of H. Res. 639 - Authorizing the Speaker to appear as amicus curiae on behalf of the House of Representatives in the matter of United States, et al. v. Texas, et al. In May 2015, Smith led a similar brief in support of the Texas suit alongside House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. More than a hundred members of the House and Senate supported that brief. Video of Rep. Smith’s remarks can be found here. Congressman Smith: “I support this resolution authorizing the speaker to submit an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of a Texas-led lawsuit challenging the president’s amnesty policies. “It is critical that the House of Representatives defend the Constitution, which specifically gives Congress, not the president, the power to enact immigration laws. Regrettably, the president’s policies have ignored laws, undermined laws, and changed immigration laws. “The president’s policies have led to a surge of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants across our borders, allowed unlawful immigrants to compete with unemployed Americans for scarce jobs, and established sanctuary cities that release dangerous criminal immigrants into our neighborhoods, where many go on to commit other crimes. The House of Representatives must reinforce the rule of law and protect the lives and livelihoods of the American people. “Mr. Speaker, that is why I support this resolution.” Smith also has vocally supported the Texas-led, 26 state lawsuit since it was first filed in December 2014. The suit challenges President Obama’s unilateral executive immigration actions, announced in November 2014, that attempted to give amnesty, work permits and government benefits to almost five million in the country illegally. The orders also did away with a successful criminal deportation program, Secure Communities.
03.16.2016	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after the House Judiciary Committee approved the Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act (H.R. 4731). Smith introduced the bill earlier this week alongside lead sponsors Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee Vice Chairman Raul Labrador (R-Idaho). Congressman Smith: “Our refugee system is broken. Terrorists have succeeded in exploiting our refugee programs to come to the U.S. and aid ISIS. The refugee program has even been abused by this administration to admit thousands of Central American immigrants coming illegally over the Southern border. The Obama administration has repeatedly refused to respond to congressional inquiries on the immigration status of terrorists charged in plots in the United States, despite reports that at least 14 were admitted to the country as refugees. Finally, taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars are often misused since questionable refugees automatically receive government benefits.” Key Components of the Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act: Places the refugee ceiling in Congress’ hands—not the President’s: The bill sets the refugee ceiling at 60,000 per year. It allows the President to recommend a revision of the ceiling number and Congress can choose to act on that recommendation. The bill prevents the President from admitting additional refugees without Congress’ approval. Empowers state and local communities: Currently, states or localities that do not want refugees resettled within their communities have no recourse. The bill remedies this issue and prevents the resettlement of refugees in any state or locality that takes legislative or executive action disapproving resettlement within their jurisdiction. Enhances integrity of refugee program and curbs fraud: It requires that when processing refugee applications from countries listed as “Countries of Particular Concern” in the annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, claims/applications that are based on religious persecution and are made by individuals who practice minority religions in such countries, are prioritized. The bill requires termination of refugee status if a resettled refugee returns to the country from which they fled, absent a change in country conditions. It requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to implement a fraudulent document detection program for refugee processing, including the placement of Fraud Detection and National Security officials at initial refugee screening, and the creation of a searchable database of scanned and categorized documents submitted by potential refugees at initial screening. It provides for regular security vetting of each admitted refugee until the refugee adjusts immigration status to lawful permanent resident. Within one year of the bill becoming law, all U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) interviews, performed during USCIS circuit rides and done with the assistance of an interpreter, are to be recorded and DHS must review a random selection of 20% of the recordings to ensure that the interpreter correctly interpreted the interview. If an interpreter is found to have incorrectly interpreted the interview, the interpreter cannot serve as an interpreter for immigration purposes. The bill requires USCIS to review open source Internet postings, including social media, for each applicant. Strengthens public safety and national security: The bill prevents the Secretary of DHS from unilaterally waiving most grounds of inadmissibility, including criminal convictions, for refugees. It also prevents the DHS Secretary from waiving most grounds of inadmissibility and deportability, including criminal grounds, for refugees attempting to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to issue a report on the security of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (including the screening and processing procedures); the number of refugees who have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 2006; and the use of federally-funded benefit programs by refugees resettled in the United States.
03.15.2016	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) responded to new reports this week revealing that, since 2010, 124 criminal immigrants that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released were re-arrested on 135 new charges of homicide. In 2014 alone, ICE released more than thirty thousand criminal immigrants instead of deporting them. Congressman Smith: “How many Americans have to lose their lives before this administration decides to enforce our immigration laws? This administration continues to release tens of thousands of criminal immigrants into American neighborhoods each year, despite the fact that many continue to commit new, deadly crimes. Just this week we learned that 124 criminal immigrants were charged with 135 homicide related charges after being previously released from U.S. prisons. When will the safety and security of Americans take priority over the failed amnesty agenda of this president? “This administration’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has cost many American their lives. And this president’s actions ignoring our immigration laws only invite more lawlessness. This week, the House will follow Texas’s lead in declaring its opposition to the president’s illegal executive actions granting amnesty, work permits, and government benefits to five million. With those actions he also did away with the successful Secure Communities program that took criminal illegal immigrants off our streets and assisted in removing them from the country. At the same time, this administration refuses to crack down on Sanctuary Cities that further endanger the public. “Our immigration system is not failing because it is broken; it is failing because it has been strategically dismantled by an extreme agenda that does not prioritize American lives and safety. This week we are reminded of 135 more reasons why the Supreme Court must restore the rule of law and overturn this president’s executive immigration actions.”
03.15.2016	Washington, D.C. – The Oversight Subcommittee today held a hearing titled “Racing to Regulate: EPA’s Latest Overreach on Amateur Drivers” to review proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations targeting amateur racecars and parts suppliers. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “Congress never intended the Clean Air Act to apply to these vehicles and the law is clear on this point. Racecars are not regulated by this law. However, EPA has now put into question the legality of non-road vehicles modified to become racecars. The EPA’s proposed expansion of authority demonstrates the agency’s willingness to resort to backdoor and secretive means to push its agenda. This overreach has the potential to result in billions of dollars in enforcement penalties simply for the production of items that have been legally used by amateur racers for years. It will stifle technological advances in this field and cause the loss of many American jobs.” For the first time, the EPA seeks to enforce the Clean Air Act on vehicles that have been legally de-registered so they can be modified for use in racing competitions. EPA officials buried this new provision in a proposed rule on emissions standards for medium and heavy-duty trucks - a regulation that is unrelated to vehicles modified for racing. The specialty equipment automotive aftermarket employs over one million Americans across the nation representing nearly $1.4 billion in sales of racing related products annually. Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.): “In addition to the major raceways throughout our country, there are thousands of local tracks that would be devastated by this new regulation. For example, the Dixie Speedway in my district in Woodstock, Georgia, is a popular community track that brings in 150,000 visitors a year. If the EPA uses this regulation to dismantle the race equipment manufacturing industry, drivers at tracks like these would be unable to find many of the parts that they need for their race cars. If the Dixie Speedway was to go out of business, our community would lose tremendous amounts of commercial activity, tourism, and recreation that have been part of our local economy and culture since the Speedway opened in 1968. What is most frustrating to me is the secretive manner that the EPA attempted to sneak in this clarification of authority – they deliberatively did this under the radar of the American people.” At the hearing, Deputy Majority Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) testified on a bill he introduced, the Recognizing the Protection of Motorsports Act of 2016 (H.R. 4715), to prevent the EPA from taking action on amateur racing under the Clean Air Act. The following witnesses also testified:Mr. Christopher Kersting, President and CEO, Specialty Equipment Marketing AssociationMr. Ralph Sheheen, Managing Partner and President, National Speed Sports NewsMr. Brent Yacobucci, Section Research Manager, Energy and Minerals Section, Congressional Research Service For more information on the hearing, including witness testimony and the archived webcast, please visit the Committee’s website.
03.10.2016	Washington, DC –Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas) responded to the release of several long-awaited Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (IG) reports on wait times for Texas veterans. Congressman Smith: “The findings of the IG’s report are discouraging but not surprising. The report underscores the fact that the Department of Veterans Affairs’ problems are systemic and widespread. That is certainly not news for the tens of thousands of veterans in my district or the millions waiting for care across the nation. I will continue to hold VA officials accountable to ensure these problems are addressed. Our veterans deserve the best care, not delayed care.” In May 2014, Smith led 23 fellow members of the Texas delegation in calling for an investigation into allegations of misconduct at three VA facilities in Texas. In June, Smith took his concerns directly to the acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs in a meeting at Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital. In September 2015 Smith assembled a Military and Veterans Council to provide regular updates on issues facing the more than 60,000 veterans, current members of the military, and the families that live in the 21st congressional district. Smith has also supported several key pieces of legislation intended to hold VA leadership accountable for widespread failures and improve care for veterans.
02.25.2016	Washington, D.C. – The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee today held a hearing on The Space Leadership Preservation Act and the need for stability at NASA. The hearing featured input from former astronaut and first female Space Shuttle pilot and commander, Eileen Collins, former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, and Rep. John Culberson, author of the Space Leadership Preservation Act. San Antonio resident and first female Space Shuttle pilot and commander Col. Eileen Collins testifies before the House Science Committee. Video from the hearing can be viewed here. Chairman Lamar Smith: “Presidential transitions often have provided a challenge to NASA programs that require continuity and budget stability. But few have been as rocky as the administration change we experienced seven years ago. “The 2005, 2008 and 2010 NASA Authorization Acts are consistent in their direction to NASA. NASA needs the same certainty from the Executive Branch that it receives from Congress. Today we are discussing how to provide that stability to NASA once again as we look toward a presidential transition in less than a year.” Rep. Culberson is the author of The Space Leadership Preservation Act and serves as the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. The bill is intended to bring stability to NASA despite changing presidential administrations. Congressman Culberson: “Over the last 30 years, NASA programs have been cancelled due to cost-overruns, mismanagement or abrupt program changes at the start of each new administration. In the past 20 years alone, 27 programs have been cancelled resulting in over $20 billion wasted on uncompleted programs. That is unacceptable. Our space program is too important to continue on this path. “The Space Leadership Preservation Act will improve our space program and improve morale at NASA centers by ensuring that we take the politics out of science and provide NASA with clear direction and guidance that outlasts the political whims of any one presidential administration – and the political whims of Congress.” Witnesses testified to the challenges NASA has faced due to abrupt changes with presidential transitions. Colonel Eileen Collins stated, “I believe program cancellation decisions that are made by bureaucracies, behind closed doors, and without input by the people, are divisive, damaging, cowardly, and many times more expensive in the long run.” And former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin lamented that “the space policy changes wrought in 2010 were not proffered to or discussed with Congress, our international partners, the various stakeholders in the domestic space community, or even senior officials at NASA.” The following witnesses testified today: Panel 1 The Honorable John Culberson, Member, U.S. House of Representatives Panel 2 The Honorable Michael Griffin, Former Administrator, NASA Colonel Eileen Collins, USAF (Retired); NASA Astronaut, Commander, STS-93 and 114; NASA Astronaut, Pilot, STS-63 and 94 Ms. Cristina Chaplain, Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management, U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) For more information about today’s hearing, including witness testimony and the archived webcast, please visit the Committee’s website.
02.23.2016	Washington, DC –Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to President Obama’s plans to shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention center which houses terrorist detainees. The plan calls for transferring some of the detainees to the U.S. Congressman Smith: “The president has already demonstrated he is willing to break current laws to enact his agenda, such as with the release of Guantanamo Bay detainees. That decision was a dangerous and short-sighted one which resulted in terrorists attempting to return to the battlefield. Americans do not want to close Guantanamo Bay and they are tired of this president treating terrorists like citizens. We will not allow the president to put his political promises above the safety and well-being of the American people.” The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office released a report in 2014 stating that the Obama Administration violated the law when it traded five senior Taliban detainees in exchange for release of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. The administration only gave Congress two days’ notice of the trade, despite the fact that the law requires the administration to inform Congress at least 30 days before any prisoner exchange from Guantanamo Bay. It also said the Defense Department wrongly used $988,400 from a wartime appropriations to facilitate the transfer.
02.23.2016	Washington, D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith today joined over 200 colleagues in both the House and Senate to file an amicus brief supporting petitions filed by 27 states seeking to overturn the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. Chairman Smith: “The EPA’s energy regulations would shut down power plants, raise Americans’ energy bills and have no significant impact on global warming. The Supreme Court earlier this month confirmed that this regulation overreaches EPA's legal authority. Despite legal setbacks, the Obama administration has continued to push its unpopular and extreme climate agenda on the American people. The Clean Power Plan has been appropriately halted by the Supreme Court and should now be blocked from enactment once and for all.” On Feb. 9 the Supreme Court halted enactment of the regulation, saying that it would shut down power plants and negatively impact local communities. Today’s amicus brief urges the court to go a step further to block the rule from enactment. Chairman Smith joined the brief with 34 Senators and 171 House Members in the case of State of West Virginia, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency, et al. The EPA’s own data has been used to show that the plan would only result in a 1/100th of a degree change in temperature.
02.22.2016	SAN ANTONIO–Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today congratulated members of the middle school team from the BASIS San Antonio Medical Center, who recently won the regional competition for the National Science Bowl Competition. Smith serves as the Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Chairman Lamar Smith: “Congratulations to the students, teachers, and parents of BASIS San Antonio Medical Center. These young scholars represent the next generation of American innovators, scientists, and engineers. We must continue to encourage students to pursue STEM careers and lead our nation into the future.” Students will have the opportunity to compete at the National Science Bowl in Washington, DC in April.
02.18.2016	Washington, D.C. – The president today signed into law the bipartisan Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act (READ Act) (H.R. 3033). The READ Act, introduced by Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), supports important research to further our understanding of dyslexia, including better methods for early detection and teacher training. Above, Chairman Smith joins students at the Rawson Saunders School in Austin to celebrate the READ Act. Dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and one in six Americans in some form. The House passed the READ Act last October with unanimous support and today approved a Senate amendment, officially sending the bill to the president’s desk for his signature. Chairman Smith: “Today we can help millions of Americans have a brighter and more prosperous future. Despite the prevalence of dyslexia, many Americans remain undiagnosed, untreated and silently struggle at school or work. We need to enable those with dyslexia to achieve their maximum potential. I am glad that the House and Senate were able to work together and send the president a good bipartisan bill to help accomplish this goal.” The READ Act requires the president’s annual budget request to Congress to include the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation (NSF). As amended, the bill requires the NSF to devote at least $2.5 million annually to dyslexia research, which would focus on best practices in the following areas: •Early identification of children and students with dyslexia •Professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators •Curricula development and evidence-based educational tools for children with dyslexia The READ Act authorizes dyslexia research projects using funds appropriated for the National Science Foundation. The bill would also authorize $2.5 million for research focused on other learning disabilities, including those which are also associated with dyslexia. Chairman Smith introduced the READ Act with Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), who are co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus. The Caucus is comprised of over 100 Members of Congress and is dedicated to increasing public awareness about dyslexia and ensuring that all students have equal educational opportunities.

02.10.2016	Washington, D.C. – House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week signed the bipartisan Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act (READ Act) (H.R. 3033). The READ Act, introduced by Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), supports important research to further our understanding of dyslexia, including better methods for early detection and teacher training. It passed both the House and Senate last week and now awaits signature into law by the president. Above, Chairman Smith joins House Speaker Paul Ryan for signing of H.R. 3033, the READ Act.

02.09.2016	Washington, DC - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to President Obama’s final budget proposal for fiscal year 2017. Congressman Lamar Smith: “President Obama has now missed eight opportunities to balance the budget and address the real fiscal crisis facing our nation. Instead, he has delivered a tax-and-spend plan year after year that has grown our debt to $19 trillion. If this budget were to be implemented, it would more than double our national debt from what it was when the president took office. “This year’s budget proposal alone would increase spending by $2.5 trillion and raise taxes by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. Just one of these proposals would tax oil at $10 per barrel, punishing domestic energy developers and raising prices at the pump by 24 cents a gallon. “This unrealistic wishlist undermines any remaining credibility the president might have had for working with Congress on serious priorities this year. I will only support a budget that balances and that works for the American people.”
02.05.2016	McAllen, Texas –Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today led members of the Congressional Border Security Caucus on a tour of Rio Grande Valley sector of the U.S.- Mexico border. Members released the following statements: Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “A country that has lost control of its border has lost control of its future. Despite the story the Obama administration is telling, illegal border crossings remain abnormally high. The Department of Homeland Security’s latest numbers show an increase of 30 percent over the last year’s crossings. “Today we had the opportunity to see firsthand the challenges our border patrol agents and Texas Department of Public Safety officers face as they deal with the continuing surge of illegal immigrants on our Southern border. Their jobs have been made harder by this administration’s policies that have undermined our immigration laws and continue to encourage illegal immigrants. “My colleagues and I with the Congressional Border Security Caucus have taken a strong stand- along with 26 states led by Texas – against the president’s executive amnesty orders. This year, the Supreme Court will hear that case. We will continue to stand with the American people. We will continue working to stop the surge of illegal immigrants.�? Congressman Diane Black (R-Tennessee): “We’ve known all along that our border was not secure and that the Obama Administration’s immigration policies were failing to uphold the rule of law. Now, I have seen the impact of that with my own eyes. Tennessee may not be a border state, but President Obama’s unwillingness to combat the crisis of illegal immigration is felt throughout the country, including in states like my own. This site visit with my Border Security Caucus colleagues has reaffirmed my belief that any future immigration reform must take place in a step-by-step process beginning with true enforcement of our existing laws and, at long last, real border security.�? Congressman Michael Burgess (R-Texas): “The flood of illegal immigrants on the Southern border has proven to be a mounting American crisis, greatly impacting Texas families. As Texans know all too well, the haphazard opening of our borders has caused total chaos with the influx of unaccompanied minors and strained our local communities in a truly troubling way. Today’s visit to the border has only reaffirmed my commitment to protecting and strengthening our borders, prioritizing the safety of American citizens above all. I join my fellow Republicans in calling on President Obama to halt his careless immigration policy before we reach a dangerous point of which we cannot return.�? Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas): “We must take the situation at the border very seriously and the current administration is not doing that. To be here and see firsthand, to talk to the agents face-to-face, it is clear the administration is not giving agents the tools they need to do their job effectively and safely. The Justice department isn't prosecuting people they should be prosecuting. Border security should be a top priority for this president, but is not. The president is not allowing our Border Patrol agents to do their job and that is putting every American at risk. �? Congressman Sam Johnson (R-Texas): "While this certainly wasn't my first trip to Texas' southern border, the new surge of illegal aliens over the past few months is why I made this trip today. It's no secret that Obama's lawless executive amnesty is having devastating impacts not only on Texas border cities but across the country. That's why I've been hard at work to stop illegal immigration and Obama’s amnesty. As part of that effort I've introduced several pieces of legislation such as my bill - the No Amnesty Tax Refunds for Illegals Act - that was just signed into law. I and my fellow Border Caucus colleagues most sacred duty is to protect our homeland and every citizen in it. I spent 29 years as a fighter pilot and seven as a POW doing just that. And the House Border Caucus will continue to fight to keep America safe."
02.04.2016	Washington, D.C. – The House of Representatives today cleared the way for the bipartisan Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act (READ Act) (H.R. 3033) to be signed into law.

02.04.2016	Washington, D.C. – House Republican leaders today named Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to a special taskforce that will address how the Republican party can work together to roll back regulatory burdens at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies. Chairman Smith: “Under the Obama administration the number and cost of government regulations has skyrocketed, killing jobs and costing the American economy billions of dollars per year. Hardworking families want their leaders in Washington to cut regulatory red tape and put America back on a path to growth and prosperity. I am pleased the Speaker has selected the Science Committee to help lead a taskforce that will find ways to reduce the burden of costly and unnecessary regulations. “Everyone agrees that we need to protect the environment, but we must do so in a way that is open and honest. Unfortunately, the EPA and other federal agencies bend the law and stretch the science to justify their own objectives. Despite heavy and growing public opposition to these proposals, the Obama administration is actively going around Congress to commit the U.S. to costly new regulations that will do nothing to improve the environment but will negatively impact economic growth. I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to come up with solutions to reduce regulatory burdens on hardworking American families.” In their announcement, the Speaker’s Office said that the goal of the taskforce is to make it easier to invest, produce, and build things in America with a regulatory system that reduces bureaucracy and eases the burden on small businesses and job creators, while still protecting the environment, public safety, and consumer interests.
02.03.2016	WASHINGTON – Today, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and U.S. Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and John Cornyn (R-TX), along with U.S. Representatives Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) and Pete Olson (R-TX), led a broad Congressional coalition filing an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in support of Texas HB 2, which establishes standards for abortion providers and facilities. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt later this Spring. Rep. Smith: “States like Texas have both the right and the responsibility to ensure the highest health and safety standards for their citizens. This bill includes practical, common-sense measures that protect lives and prioritize women’s health. I hope that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of life and states’ rights to regulate within their own borders.” Sen. Cruz: “Those who advocate for abortion often claim that it should be ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ Unfortunately, abortion is not always ‘safe’ for women. Not long ago, we saw just how dangerous an unscrupulous abortionist can be. Kermit Gosnell, who ran a Philadelphia abortion mill, treated his women patients little better than the unborn babies he slaughtered. He subjected the women in his care to unsanitary, degrading, and inhumane treatment, undermining their dignity and health, and even taking one of their lives. In response to this horror, the Texas Legislature enacted H.B. 2, just like other state legislatures across the country, to ensure that abortion clinics are held to the same medical standards as other medical facilities. But even this commonsense regulation for the protection of women is too much for the abortion lobby, which has challenged the regulation all the way to the Supreme Court. For the most zealous abortion advocates, nothing—not even women’s health—can be allowed to stand in the way of abortion-on-demand. Today, a bipartisan group of 174 members of Congress have filed an amicus brief in defense of the right of legislatures across the country to enact medical protections for women. I am honored to have worked with my fellow senator from Texas, John Cornyn, and with Reps. Vicky Hartzler, Pete Olson, and Lamar Smith to bring this mighty coalition together.” Sen. Cornyn: “By requiring abortion clinics to be held to the same standards as other medical facilities, the Texas law protects the health of both the mother and child. Upholding this law is important not just for the well-being of women and children in Texas, but to preserve the right of states to pass laws that are in the best interests of its citizens.” Rep. Hartzler: “The potential impacts of this case are staggering. Upholding this law ensures that the abortion facilities don’t get a free pass on health and safety standards at the expense of women’s health, and it could serve as a template for other states. Overturning it endangers women’s health and could place other reasonable regulations on abortion in jeopardy. The infamous abortionist Kermit Gosnell was not an outlier—we must protect women and children from other Gosnells.” Rep. Olson: “Texas has a sacred duty to protect the health of our residents, which is why physicians performing abortions must practice the same safety standards as every other medical practitioner. Our Constitution gives states the autonomy to determine the best laws to protect public health. I was proud to join both of our Texas Senators, every Texas US House Republican and a bipartisan group of 147 other Senators and House members in urging the US Supreme Court to uphold this life saving Texas state law. Women seeking an abortion and the unborn babies who may survive an abortion attempt deserve quality care in the event of an emergency. The Supreme Court should give deference to states like Texas on matters of life and health.” In total, 34 Senators and 140 Members of the House Representatives have signed onto the brief, which can be found here.
02.02.2016	Washington, D.C. – The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology today held a hearing to examine the various scientific, economic and other policy issues surrounding President Obama’s recent pledge to the United Nations-led effort to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. The president pledged that the United States will cut its greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 28 percent over the next decade and by 80 percent or more by 2050. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “The president’s Paris pledge will increase electricity costs, ration energy and slow economic growth. Congress has repeatedly rejected the president’s extreme climate agenda. The president’s climate pledge is a bad deal for the American economy, the American people and would produce no substantive environmental benefits.” A video of Chairman Smith’s full statement is available here. Witnesses today questioned the legality of the agreement and stressed that the president’s pledge lacks constitutional legitimacy since it has not been ratified by the Senate. In addition to promised greenhouse gas reductions, the Paris agreement would require the United States to contribute billions of taxpayer dollars to developing countries to reduce their carbon emissions. Witnesses today questioned how the administration intends to honor this agreement without Congressional approval, since all public funds must be appropriated through Congress. Witnesses were also critical of whether the agreement would have any significant impact on climate change. For example, the U.S. pledge to the U.N. is estimated to prevent only one-fiftieth of one degree Celsius temperature rise over the next 85 years. And EPA’s own data shows that the administration’s costly Clean Power Plan regulation that is the cornerstone of its pledge would reduce sea level rise by one one-hundredth of an inch, or the thickness of three sheets of paper. In December, a majority of Congress disapproved of the EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulation through the Congressional Review Act. The governors of most states are also challenging the rule in court. The following witness testified today:Mr. Steve Eule, Vice President for Climate and Technology, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Dr. John Christy, Professor of Atmospheric Science and Director of the Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville Dr. Andrew Steer, President and CEO, World Resources Institute Mr. Steven Groves, The Bernard and Barbara Lomas Senior Research Fellow, Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, The Heritage Foundation For more information about today’s hearing, including witness testimony and the hearing webcast, please visit the Committee’s website.
01.28.2016	Washington, D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Space Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin (R-Texas) released the following statements today in observance of NASA’s Day of Remembrance for those who lost their lives in the Apollo 1, Columbia, and Challenger missions. Chairman Smith: “Each year, our nation pauses to remember those who lost their lives during the Apollo 1, Challenger, and Columbia missions. We are reminded that the last 50 years of American space exploration have been full of great risks as well as great triumphs. We must never forget the trails these men and women blazed. I am encouraged by the new generation of innovators and explorers rising up to follow in their footsteps.” Space Subcommittee Chairman Babin: “Today we honor those who lost their lives while pushing the limits of human spaceflight and exploration. The sacrifices of these pioneers – the Apollo 1, Challenger and Columbia astronaut crews, as well as many pilots and other employees – will never be forgotten. Their service and commitment will continue to inspire future generations deeper into space.”
01.14.2016	Washington, D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent letters to several private companies that provided software and services to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that enabled her to maintain a private email server.Chairman Smith: “Understanding these companies’ roles in providing software and services to maintain former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server is critical to improving government cybersecurity standards. A high profile government official deviating from established information security requirements raises significant concerns. The sensitive nature of the information stored on Sec. Clinton’s private server created a unique challenge to ensure all of the information was properly safeguarded. The Committee takes seriously its duty to ensure the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is properly equipped to safeguard our nation’s information.” Earlier this month, the Committee held a hearing where a private sector cybersecurity expert told the Committee his company would not set up a private server for a government official because such an arrangement is “illegal” and because it would expose classified data. Today’s letters are aimed at improving the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the Framework) and the Federal Information Security Act (FISMA), which set cybersecurity standards and enable federal oversight of information technology programs. Last year, more than 178 million records on Americans were exposed in cyber attacks. According to the Government Accountability Office, in 2014, federal agencies reported more than 60,000 cyber security incidents that exposed personally identifiable information. Moreover, the State Department scored only a 42 out of 100 on the federal government’s cybersecurity report card. This score is lower than the Office of Personnel Management’s score, an agency that recently experienced an attack that exposed the private information of 20 million Americans. In his letters today, Chairman Smith requests all documents and communications related to Secretary Clinton’s private server as well as information about any security breaches that may have occurred during her tenure. Full copies of the letters can be found below:Letter to Mr. Austin McChord, CEO, Datto, Inc.Letter to Mr. Victor Nappe, CEO, SECNAP Network Security Corp.Letter to Mr. Treve Suazo, CEO, Platte River NetworksLetter to Mr. Ken Xie, CEO, Forinet, Inc.
01.13.2016	Washington, D.C. –Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in favor of a Congressional Review Act resolution (S.J. Res. 22) disapproving of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Waters of the United States (WOTUS) regulation. The House approved the resolution which will now be sent to President Obama for signature. Chairman Smith spoke in favor of passage on the House floor. Click image above or HERE to watch on YouTube Chairman Lamar Smith: “Mr. Speaker, I support S.J. Res 22, which rejects the Environmental Protection Agency’s Waters of the United States rule. This rule is just another one of EPA’s many attempts to expand its jurisdiction and increase its power to regulate American waterways – even if that means invading Americans’ own backyards. “The Science Committee’s oversight hearings revealed that the EPA made arbitrary decisions in writing this rule and justified it with phony science. And the Government Accountability Office found that the EPA’s use of social media to promote the rule violated the law. “The Obama administration will do anything and say anything to impose its liberal agenda on the American people. I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res 22 and disapprove the Waters of the United States rule. I yield back the balance of my time.” Smith has sent several letters to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy questioning the agency's rushed process and lack of transparency in pushing the WOTUS rule on the American people. More than 30 governors and state legislators across the country have also voiced their concerns about the threats to freedom and opportunity posed by this regulatory overreach. Smith also sent a letter questioning claims by the Administrator about the scientific foundation for the WOTUS rule. Last year, Smith voted in favor of the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which requires the EPA to withdraw the rule and seek out adequate stakeholder input before proposing a new rule. In 2014, the Science Committee investigated the EPA's creation of detailed maps showing waters and wetlands for all 50 states. The maps, which were created in 2013 shortly after EPA proposed its Waters of the US rule, had never been made public. Although the EPA has claimed the maps were not used to regulate, the agency has failed to explain why the agency used taxpayer money to create them in the first place. Serious questions remain regarding the EPA's underlying motivations for creating such highly detailed maps.
01.12.2016	Washington, DC - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement on the evening of the president’s annual State of the Union address: Click here or on the photo above for video of Rep. Smith’s response. Congressman Lamar Smith: “It is no surprise that President Obama would try to put a positive spin on his presidency. But his claims conflict with reality. Two-thirds of Americans now think the country is going in the wrong direction. “Both the president’s foreign and domestic policies are making things worse. Our enemies no longer fear us and our friends and allies don’t trust us. The world is more dangerous now than when President Obama took office. Wages are flat and millions remain unemployed thanks to slow economic growth. And everyday Americans are burdened by costly and unnecessary regulations. “Like most Americans, I want to strengthen our national security, which includes border security, immigration enforcement, and changes to our visa and refugee screening. This week, I’m voting for legislation to keep Iran sanctions in place and expand sanctions on North Korea because these countries continue to threaten world peace. “I also will continue working to hold the Obama administration accountable for job-killing regulations. I’ll vote this week to reject the EPA’s controversial Waters of the U.S. rule, which would greatly expand the government’s power to regulate American waterways and even Americans’ own backyards.”
01.08.2016	Washington, DC - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to reports that two Iraqi refugees have been arrested this week in Texas and California for actions aiding terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State. Congressman Lamar Smith: “It is disturbing, though not surprising, that terrorists have succeeded in exploiting our refugee system to come to the U.S. and aid ISIS. These groups have been open about their intentions to infiltrate the tens of thousands of Middle East refugees this administration is determined to bring to our shores. Even worse, this president’s response to acts of terror like the San Bernardino shooting is to punish law-abiding Americans and endorse gun control measures. It is time to stop treating terrorists like citizens and citizens like terrorists. This president’s unwillingness to confront the real security threats we face is nothing short of dangerous. This week’s arrests in Houston and California are more reasons we should temporarily halt all admission and resettlement of refugees until we can verify that every single ‘gap’ in our security screening has been addressed. This is also why I support the right of governors, like Governor Abbott, to protect citizens by refusing to allow the federal government to resettle refugees in states like Texas.” In December, Smith joined Texas Representative Ted Poe and Senator Ted Cruz in introducing the State Refugee Security Act of 2015, legislation to protect states’ rights to refuse to participate in the federal refugee resettlement program. Smith also joined fellow Representatives Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Lou Barletta (R-Penn.), and Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) in introducing legislation that would halt and defund all refugee admission and resettlement until reports on the safety, costs, and history of terrorism among refugees have been submitted to Congress. Congress would also be required to pass a joint resolution in order to re-start the program.
01.06.2016	Washington, DC - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting for H.R. 3762, Restoring American’s Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Almost six years after ObamaCare was rammed through Congress, 52 percent of Americans disapprove of the president’s health care law. It continues to be a nightmare for millions who have lost their health plans and their doctors and who have been hit with higher prices and higher deductibles for their health insurance. Republicans have persisted in our attempts to repeal, replace, dismantle or defund ObamaCare. This week for the first time Congress is sending a bill to the president’s desk to repeal and dismantle this failed law. This bill also reduces the deficit by more than $500 billion and eliminates all federal funding for abortion providers.” According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, under ObamaCare the cost of insurance in Texas has increased by 79 percent for the average 27-year-old man, and 54 percent for the average 40-year-old man. The average 27-year-old woman has seen increases of 29 percent and the average 64-year-old woman’s insurance has increased by 18 percent.
01.05.2016	Washington, DC - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to President Obama’s actions on gun control. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The president’s actions punish law-abiding citizens. Our country would be much safer if he were half as tough on criminals as he is on innocent Americans. Nothing in the president’s proposal would have prevented the recent killings that took place. I will continue to oppose all efforts by this administration to undermine the Second Amendment freedoms guaranteed to every citizen. “Americans are tired of President Obama’s repeated attempts to enact his extreme agenda through executive orders. These executive actions have never been about the will of Americans, they are about checking off the remaining items on a far-left agenda as this administration fades into the sunset.”
12.18.2015	Washington, DC - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting against a year-end omnibus appropriations bill. Congressman Lamar Smith: “This bill includes priorities such as funding for the dilapidated San Antonio courthouse and a repeal of the outdated oil export ban. “Overall, I could not support this $1.1 trillion bill. It lacks serious reforms of our refugee policy and fully funds plans to admit tens of thousands of Syrian refugees into our country. It does nothing to prohibit the White House from funding its Green Climate Fund and serves as an endorsement of the president’s extreme agenda he committed to in Paris. Similarly, it omits congressionally-passed restrictions on controversial EPA regulations. It admits 264,000 unskilled guestworkers to compete in the job market against unemployed Americans for scarce jobs. Finally, it does nothing to defund Planned Parenthood despite the fact that it appears the organization engaged in the sale of unborn baby body parts.”
12.17.2015	Washington, DC - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 2029, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I will take every opportunity to ease the tax burden on Texas families. This package makes several positive reforms permanent, including crucial research and development tax credits, provisions to assist small businesses, state and local sales tax deductions, and deductions for charitable giving. It also extends mortgage debt forgiveness for another year, and delays harmful ObamaCare taxes such as the medical device tax and the “cadillac tax” that would result in even larger health insurance increases for many families across the country. It also includes provisions to curb illegal immigrants’ fraudulent collection of tax credits. Finally, the bill includes a series of reforms that the House has passed to rein in the IRS, fire employees who take politically-motivated actions against taxpayers, and prohibit IRS employees from using personal email accounts for official business.”
12.17.2015	Washington, DC – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined fellow lawmakers in sponsoring a resolution to impeach Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner John Koskinen. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The IRS Commissioner should have put the public interest ahead of this administration’s political agenda. What the IRS did was a threat to democracy. Americans have lost confidence in IRS Commissioner Koskinen’s ability to lead what should be one of the most non-partisan agencies in the federal government. He has sought to cover up the agency’s political harassment of conservative organizations. This is inexcusable. It is a shame that Congress has to file an impeachment resolution because this administration should have fired him over a year ago.” The resolution specifically cites the following charges against Commissioner Koskinen: Failed to comply with a subpoena resulting in destruction of key evidence. Commissioner Koskinen failed to locate and preserve IRS records in accordance with a congressional subpoena and an internal preservation order. The IRS erased 422 backup tapes containing as many as 24,000 of Lois Lerner’s emails – key pieces of evidence that were destroyed on Koskinen’s watch. Failed to testify truthfully and provided false and misleading information. Commissioner Koskinen testified the IRS turned over all emails relevant to the congressional investigation, including all of Ms. Lerner’s emails. When the agency determined Ms. Lerner’s emails were missing, Commissioner Koskinen testified the emails were unrecoverable. These statements were false. Failed to notify Congress that key evidence was missing. The IRS knew Lois Lerner’s emails were missing in February 2014. In fact, they were not missing; the IRS destroyed the emails on March 4, 2014. The IRS did not notify Congress the emails were missing until June 2014 – four months later, and well after the White House and the Treasury Department were notified. In addition to sponsoring the impeachment resolution, Smith today voted for a tax extenders bill that included previously-passed House measures to protect taxpayers and rein in the IRS.
12.16.2015	Washington, D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after receiving an initial production of documents and communications from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The documents partially fulfill NOAA’s obligation under a lawfully-issued Committee subpoena dated October 13, 2015. Chairman Lamar Smith: “I am encouraged by NOAA’s acknowledgment of its obligation to produce documents and communications in response to the Committee’s lawfully-issued subpoena. I am also glad to see that NOAA has committed to produce additional items as they are identified. We will carefully review these documents and expect additional productions from NOAA.” In a letter to the Committee, NOAA asserted that it is “continuing to search for additional documents that may be responsive to this request.” In June, NOAA widely publicized a study as refuting the nearly two-decade pause in climate change. After three letters requesting all communications from the agency surrounding the role of political appointees in the agency’s scientific process, Chairman Smith issued a subpoena for the information. Smith subsequently sent a letter on December 1st offering to accept documents and communications from NOAA political, policy and non-scientific staff as a first step in satisfying the subpoena requirements. Information provided to the Committee by whistleblowers appears to show that the study was rushed to publication despite the concerns and objections of a number of NOAA employees.
12.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C—Today, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) joined Congressman Ted Poe (R-Texas) in introducing H.R. 4197, the State Refugee Security Act of 2015, a companion bill to Senator Ted Cruz’s legislation (S. 2363). Smith previously sponsored similar legislation with Poe, H.R. 4032, introduced on November 17, which would protect states’ rights to refuse to participate in the federal refugee resettlement program. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The federal government should not force states like Texas to accept Syrian refugees they view as a security threat. We continue to hear about our limitations in vetting these refugees, yet administration officials have testified that 80 to 90 percent are being approved for admission. This is why I continue to fully support this legislation and the actions of governors like Texas Governor Abbott to protect the residents and the interests of their states.” Under H.R. 4197 and S. 2363, the federal government is required to notify a state at least 21 days prior to resettling a refugee there. During that period, if a state governor certifies that the federal government has not provided adequate assurances that the refugee does not present a security risk, the federal government is prohibited from resettling that refugee in the state.
12.10.2015	Washington, DC - U.S. Representatives Lamar Smith (R-TX), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Lou Barletta (R-PA), and Scott DesJarlais (R-TN) today introduced legislation that would temporarily halt the refugee resettlement program by cutting off funding for any resettlement activity. Under the bill, no funding would be made available for refugee resettlement operations until the following four conditions are met: • Congress passes a joint resolution approving the President’s refugee resettlement plan • CBO provides a report to Congress scoring the long term cost of refugee resettlement operations • DHS submits a report to Congress identifying terrorist and criminal activity of refugees admitted into the U.S. since 2001 • The President submits a report to Congress of the prior year’s cost of admitting refugees and proposes offsetting spending cuts to pay for resettlementRep. Smith: “Recent attacks justify a temporary halt in our current refugee resettlement program. We have asked this administration for reports on the number of refugees admitted in recent years, the associated costs, and the number who have engaged in acts of terrorism or committed crimes. Americans deserve answers to these questions, yet the administration has failed to provide them. Our bill is simple: no more refugee admittance until we can strengthen the system and better ensure the safety of Americans. For this administration to force foreign refugees on American communities at this time ignores the very real security threats we face.”Rep. Blackburn: “President Obama’s plan to admit thousands of additional Syrian refugees into this country at a time of heightened jihadist threats and the San Bernardino massacre is beyond reckless. It endangers our national security and costs hard working taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, which is why an omnibus funding bill should not include a blank check for refugee resettlement. We must confront the danger of radical Islamic extremism. Our legislation will allow Congress to check the President’s irresponsible resettlement agenda.” Rep. Barletta: “The attack in California demonstrated once again that there are radical Islamic terrorists whose main goal in life is to kill Americans. While the United States has always been a nation that welcomes people seeking refuge, it is only prudent to suspend our refugee program until we know exactly who we are letting in. The people’s representatives in Congress should have a say in who is admitted, how much relocating them will cost, and what security risks are associated with them. Until we have a handle on a dependable vetting process, we should put national security first and call a temporary halt to the refugee program.”Rep. DesJarlais: “The United States has always been a kind and caring nation. However, we must not forget our government’s primary constitutional responsibility of ensuring the safety of the American public. As such, it is incumbent upon our elected officials to establish protocols that will properly safeguard our country from those who come here solely to do us harm. Unfortunately, President Obama’s own administration has publicly admitted that under the current framework, Syrian refugees cannot be vetted in a way that meets the rigorous security standards we rightfully expect. Therefore, it is critical we halt the refugee program until Congress is satisfied any individual admitted will not pose a security risk now or in the future.” Click here to read the full text of the legislation.
12.08.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting for the Visa Waiver Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Participation in the Visa Waiver Program is a privilege, not a right. With growing threats all around us, countries that are granted this privilege must meet a high security standard. We know that individuals from visa waiver countries have traveled to Iraq and Syria in order to join ISIS. We must do everything in our power to prevent these same terrorists from coming to the U.S.” Currently, residents from 38 countries that participate in the program are granted access more easily to the U.S. for travel up to 90 days. Instead of going to a U.S. consulate or embassy, citizens of participating countries must provide detailed background information that is then screened against U.S. security systems. However, many of the participating countries fail to provide the U.S. intelligence community with the information it needs to certify visitors pose no threat. In addition, it is estimated that as many as 5,000 Europeans have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, many of whom are from countries that participate in the Visa Waiver Program. The bill that passed the House today allows the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to suspend a country’s participation in the program if they fail to share counterterrorism information with the U.S., denies Visa Waiver Program status to those citizens from participating countries that have traveled to certain terrorist hotspots since 2011, requires all Visa Waiver Program countries use fraud resistant “e-passports”, and allows for the suspension of high-risk countries.
12.03.2015	“Our nation is presented with serious economic and security threats emanating from our refugee resettlement programs. Congress cannot, and must not, issue a blank check to [the office of Refugee Resettlement], especially at a time when the Administration is actively in defiance of federal law.” WASHINGTON, DC— Congressmen Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) joined U.S. Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Richard Shelby (R-AL) in releasing the following letter that was sent yesterday to the Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell: “Dear Secretary Burwell: It has come to our attention that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has failed to submit an annual report to Congress regarding the activities of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), in violation of federal law. Section 413(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, requires the Secretary of HHS to submit an annual report to Congress ‘no later than the January 31 following the end of each fiscal year[.]’ The FY2014 report – which was due no later than January 31 of this year – is still outstanding, and must be produced immediately. In its FY2016 ‘Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees,’ HHS requested over $1.6 billion for ORR. This request illustrates the exponential growth in ORR’s budget in recent years. Indeed, as recently as FY2012, ORR received $768,334,000 in funding – or less than half of what it currently seeks. Our nation is presented with serious economic and security threats emanating from our refugee resettlement programs. Congress cannot, and must not, issue a blank check to ORR, especially at a time when the Administration is actively in defiance of federal law. We look forward to the immediate submission of ORR’s FY2014 Annual Report to Congress. Very truly yours. Senator Jeff Sessions Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn Senator Richard Shelby Congressman Lamar Smith” [NOTE: To view the signed letter as a PDF, please click here.]
12.03.2015	Washington, D.C. – Today the Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Energy held a hearing to examine H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. The bipartisan bill was introduced by Energy Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber (R-Texas) along with Full Committee Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) and Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas). Energy Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber: “This legislation is of critical importance. We have to maintain our R&D capabilities to develop cutting edge nuclear technology here in America or in the not-too-distant future, we’ll be importing reactors from overseas. Furthermore, we cannot afford to lose engineering and manufacturing jobs in the nuclear sector when we have the best talent in the world right now. America’s export economy is a key to our global strength and this bill will provide a long term plan to ensure that we do not lose our talent.” Chairman Lamar Smith: “This legislation enables our talented engineers in the private sector, academia, and at the national labs to develop the next generation of nuclear technology here in the United States. It produces bipartisan long term R&D investments that will help spur American competitiveness and keep us on the forefront of nuclear energy technology.” Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson: “I am very pleased to co-sponsor the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, more efficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors. Nuclear power currently plays a pivotal role in providing our country with reliable energy.” Texas lawmakers were joined by University of Texas Associate Vice Chancellor for Research, Dr. Dale Klein, who testified to the legislation’s importance. Dr. Dale Klein: “H.R. 4084 is an important first step toward aligning federal nuclear policies with today's realities, and if enacted, I believe would create a more collaborative relationship between government and private sector to advance nuclear science and promote innovation. “It is my belief, and sincere hope, that this legislation will provide the Congress and the Administration a common ground to rebuild our national nuclear science and technology infrastructure and reinvigorate the collaborative relationship between government and private sector that drives innovation.” The following witnesses testified today: Mr. John Kotek, Acting Assistant Secretary, Office of Nuclear Energy, U.S. Department of EnergyDr. Dale Klein, Associate Vice Chancellor for Research, University of TexasMr. Ray Rothrock, Partner Emeritus, Venrock
12.01.2015	Washington, D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement after voting to support two Senate-passed measures that block job-killing EPA regulations: the Congressional Disapproval of the EPA’s CO2 Rule for Existing Power Plants (S.J. Res. 24) and the Congressional Disapproval of the EPA’s CO2 Rule for New Power Plants (S.J. Res. 23). Chairman Smith: “This week, President Obama is in Paris trying to negotiate climate change regulations. His pledge to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 28 percent in the next 10 years is an attempt to bypass Congress and the American people. But worse, his plan to get us there, the EPA’s Power Plan, will do a world of harm to Americans while doing almost nothing to impact climate change. This massive regulation will cause us to lose jobs and will increase electricity prices dramatically. Few states will be hit as hard as Texas, where estimates show that energy costs could increase by 16 percent per year by 2030.That is why I have opposed this regulation at every turn, and that is why I will continue to oppose this administration’s extreme climate agenda. The alternative leaves Americans holding a costly tab for regulations they don’t want and that will have little impact on climate change.”
11.24.2015	Washington, D.C. – House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), and Space Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin (R-Texas) today praised a private space company’s successful test of a reusable rocket at a test facility in West Texas. The company, Blue Origin, was the first ever to successfully launch and vertically land a rocket, which enables reuse. Chairman Lamar Smith: “We are living in historic and exciting times. Congratulations to Blue Origin on the successful launch and landing of the New Shepard rocket yesterday in West Texas. Reusable rockets could revolutionize the space industry and promise to make future space exploration more affordable. This is one of many firsts for American space innovators and it is the reason why the SPACE Act that Congress recently passed is so important. Texas continues to play a leading role in America’s space story, just as we have for the last 50 years.” Space Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin: "Blue Origin’s successful flight is a significant step in making space tourism a reality in Texas and the United States. Congratulations to the entire team for their vision, ingenuity and tireless efforts in ensuring the United States is the home of commercial space.” The test comes on the heels of passage of the SPACE Act, landmark bipartisan legislation that encourages private American space companies to continue investing in crucial research, development, and testing without the threat of new and overbearing government regulations. Chairman Smith partnered with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), lead sponsor of the bill, to see it through to final passage in the House and Senate. It now awaits the president’s signature.
11.19.2015	Washington, D.C. – The Committee on Science, Space and Technology held a hearing today entitled, “The Administration’s Empty Promises for the International Climate Treaty” to examine how the administration will have difficulty meeting its commitments to the United Nations based on recent Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) carbon emissions regulations. Video is available on YouTube. Chairman Smith: Over the last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released some of the most expensive and burdensome regulations in its history. Today’s hearing will examine how the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) recent regulations will do little to meet the administration’s pledge at the upcoming Paris talks to reduce global carbon emissions. The so-called Clean Power Plan will cost billions of dollars, cause financial hardship for American families, and diminish the competitiveness of American industry around the world, all with no significant benefit to climate change. It is well documented that the Clean Power Plan will shut down power plants across the country, increase electricity prices and cost thousands of Americans their jobs. New analysis by NERA Economic Consulting shows that this final rule will impose a tremendous cost on the American people. This includes $29 billion to $39 billion in annual compliance costs and annual double-digit electricity price increases in most states. My home state of Texas would be one of the hardest hit. According to a recent report by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), energy costs for customers in Texas may increase by up to 16 percent per year due to the Clean Power Plan alone. Read Chairman Smith’s full statement here. Texan Bill Magness, Senior Vice President, Governance, Risk and Compliance, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) echoed the Chairman’s concern over rising energy costs resulting from the Clean Power Plan. Video is available on YouTube. Mr. Bill Magness: The CPP will also result in increased wholesale and retail energy costs in the ERCOT Region. Based on ERCOT’s analysis, energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone, without accounting for the associated costs of transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices caused by increased gas demand, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT Region. Consideration of these factors would result in even higher energy costs for customers. Read Magness’ full testimony here.
11.19.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 4038, the American SAFE Act, with an almost veto-proof majority. Smith has called for halting and defunding the relocation of Syrian refugees, sponsored legislation to allow governors to refuse to accept Syrian refugees, and is working on legislation to address issues with refugee services for “special interest aliens” who are crossing our Southern border, as well as Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The president’s insistence that we move forward with his refugee plans is irresponsible, tone-deaf to the reality of security threats, and out-of-touch with the American people. Americans feel that bringing Syrian refugees into our country jeopardizes our security. I agree. I’ve questioned numerous Obama administration officials, including at this morning’s Immigration Subcommittee hearing, and none have been able to tell me that we have the ability to thoroughly screen these refugees. We must halt all refugee resettlement and fill in the gaps in our refugee resettlement programs.” Smith’s announcement of other legislation comes as DHS officials this week confirmed that 8 Syrians have been arrested after attempting to cross the Texas border. A recent Bloomberg poll showed that 53% of U.S. adults say the U.S. should stop taking in refugees and a NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll shows 56% of Americans oppose letting Syrian refugees into the country. At least one of the men involved in the latest ISIS attacks recently came to France as a refugee from Syria, and the terrorist group has said it will seek to infiltrate the U.S. using the refugee program. The Obama administration has said it will not change its plans to bring at least 10,000 Syrians to the U.S. in this year alone. At a Thursday morning House Judiciary hearing, Smith questioned State Department official Anne Richard, who admitted that Syrian refugees are “treated pretty much like ordinary Americans and they are not tracked.” Video from the exchange can be found below.

11.18.2015	Washington, DC - Representatives Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Brian Babin (R-Texas), and Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) are calling for a temporary suspension of Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) resettlement funding for all refugees, as well as individuals not in a legitimate lawful status. The lawmakers’ approach includes but also extends beyond refugee services for Syrian, Iraqi and other refugees and reflects the need to examine the resettlement of potential “special interest aliens” who are crossing our Southern border. The lawmakers are currently crafting language to address the issue for inclusion in an omnibus spending bill. The Members argue that congressional action to protect American citizens from Islamic State terrorists must acknowledge vulnerabilities in our overseas vetting process as well as our domestic security vulnerabilities. Islamic State terrorists can just as easily pose as illegal aliens crossing our southern border as they can refugees fleeing a war torn country overseas. The Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety was recently asked whether Islamic State terrorists had infiltrated the Southern border. He responded, “Individuals that come across the Texas/Mexican border from countries with a known terrorism presence and the answer to that is yes.”1 In April, a Judicial Watch report cited a Mexican Army officer and police inspector who asserted that ISIS was operating training bases in close proximity of the U.S. Southern border.2 Another report from August 2014 advised that social media traffic indicated ISIS was planning to “infiltrate” the Southern border in order to carry out a terrorist attack.3 ORR has failed to submit annual reports in a timely manner as required by section 413(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, despite being directly involved in the resettlement of thousands of illegal aliens who have crossed our Southern border over the past few years. Further, ORR’s budget has grown exponentially from approximately $750 million in FY2012 funding to over $1.5 billion currently. Repeated attempts by Members of Congress to conduct legitimate oversight of this entity have been met by delays, obstruction and a failure to produce information. The vetting and resettlement processes associated with services for refugees and aliens not in a legitimate lawful status must be re-examined in order to address threats from all potential access points. Accordingly, all resettlement services should be temporarily suspended. If Congress funds ORR without such restrictions, Congress will be providing the President the funds to carry out his refugee resettlement efforts in full – both from countries overseas as well as through the resettlement of illegal aliens at the Southern border. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) was established by the Refugee Act of 1980. It operates within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). According to ORR’s FY2013 Annual Report, its “mission is to link these newly-arrived populations to key resources to maximize their potential in the U.S., and to become integrated and successful members of American society.” ORR has settled more than three million refugees from seventy different countries since it was established. 1.

11.17.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today cosponsored legislation intended to give governors the ability to protect their states by refusing to accept Syrian refugees. The bill, H.R.4032, The States’ Right of Refugee Refusal Act, was introduced by Congressman Ted Poe (R-Texas). Congressman Lamar Smith: “We are not going to simply sit back and allow this administration to endanger American lives. Congress should defund and halt the relocation of Syrian refugees to the U.S. I fully support this legislation and the actions of governors like Texas Governor Abbott to protect the residents and the interests of their states.” The bill will amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to ensure that States have the right to refuse to participate in the Refugee Resettlement program if their Governor chooses to opt out. Right now, the Refugee Resettlement Act only permits consultation with the States, but it does not clearly give the States the right to refuse. At least one of the men involved in the latest ISIS attacks recently came to France as a refugee from Syria, and the terrorist group has said it will seek to infiltrate the U.S. using the refugee program. The Obama administration has said it will not change its plans to bring at least 10,000 Syrians to the U.S. in this year alone.
11.16.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement calling for a halt in Syrian refugees in light of known security issues and the most recent attacks in Paris. At least one of the men involved in the latest ISIS attacks recently came to France as a refugee from Syria. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Even before the latest brutal attacks in Paris, Americans have had grave concerns about the Obama administration’s plan to bring tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to our shores. In recent congressional hearings, I asked both FBI Director Comey and Homeland Security Secretary Johnson about the security risk these refugees pose. Both have admitted they do not currently have the ability to properly screen and conduct sufficient background checks on these individuals. Yet the president continues to insist we bring Syrian refugees to the United States. We know that at least one of the ISIS attackers emigrated to France in recent weeks as part of their refugee program. At a time when we are on high alert, all plans for relocating Syrian refugees should come to a screeching halt. We should not allow Syrian refugees into our country until this administration can guarantee that they pose no danger to the American people.” DHS Secretary Johnson and FBI Director Comey were both present at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on October 21st when Smith asked about the risks posed by Syrian refugees. In that hearing, Secretary Johnson said only that interviews were being conducted and acknowledged that “there is no risk-free process.” In a House Judiciary Committee hearing later the same week, Director Comey admitted that determining which refugees could pose a threat would be “challenging.”
11.13.2015	San Antonio, Texas— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in response to reports of multiple terrorist attacks throughout Paris. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Our hearts are deeply grieved to learn of multiple attacks throughout Paris that have taken the lives of many innocent people. These are cowardly, senseless, brutal acts of terrorism. Tonight we mourn with the people of France, and we strengthen our resolve to stand against this evil.”
11.11.2015	Boerne, Texas— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in observance of Veterans Day. Congressman Lamar Smith: “In observation of Veterans Day, we honor all the veterans, past and present, who have served our country and defended our nation’s freedoms. America is a stronger country today because of the sacrifices our veterans have made. The debt that we owe our brave servicemen and women can never fully be repaid. “Our commitment to our men and women in uniform should be more than a symbolic gesture. I have supported and the House of Representatives has passed numerous bills in the 114th Congress to uphold our promises to our veterans. These bills that increase accountability at the VA, provide jobs for servicemen and servicewomen, and ensure that all veterans receive the benefits and care they deserve. “Our commitment to our veterans is not something to remember only one day a year, but a commitment which lasts a lifetime. The 21st Congressional District is home to over 60,000 veterans, current members of the military and their families. If my office can ever be of assistance with questions or concerns regarding veterans' benefits, please contact my San Antonio, Austin or Kerrville District Offices. We stand ready to assist you.” Smith is attending a Veterans Day program Boerne, a ceremony recognizing eight living and four deceased local World War II veterans by the French Order of the Legion of Honor in Fredericksburg, and the Kerr County Veterans Day Parade. The program in Boerne will include the dedication of a new highway sign renaming a stretch of I-10 in honor of Vietnam War veteran PFC Milton A. Lee, who posthumously earned the Medal of Honor for actions in combat that cost him his life in 1968 while saving lives of others. Smith led legislation and worked with local VFW Post 688 in Boerne in a yearlong effort that resulted in Smith’s bill being signed into law in August 2015. Rep. Smith also recently partnered with the National Association of Broadcasters as part of a public service campaign showing support for our troops. The video can be viewed below. Supporting our Troops
11.06.2015	Washington, D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith today released the following statement after President Obama announced he is rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline. Chairman Smith: “The president’s decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline is a win for environmental extremists, but a loss for Americans. Years of independent analysis have clearly shown the project would not exacerbate carbon pollution. This administration routinely dismisses sound science in favor of its extreme environmental agenda. In rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline, the president said no to 40,000 new energy jobs. Americans are paying attention. This administration would rather pander to its allies than approve a project that creates thousands of jobs and promotes American energy independence.” The Committee has held hearings to review the extensive science supporting the safety and environmental features of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. The project submitted a Presidential Permit six years ago and has undergone extensive review since then. Despite claims from the president and those who oppose the project, the president’s own State Department has stated that the pipeline would “have a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline” and concluded it would have minimal impact to resources along the proposed route. This analysis includes thousands of pages of environmental impact assessment, hundreds of thousands of public comments and extensive public and interagency dialogue.
11.05.2015	Washington, D.C. – The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee today held a hearing to review actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to block the Pebble Mine from development before the project even applied for any permits. Witnesses today said that EPA did not rely on sound science in deciding to undertake a pre-emptive action to limit the Pebble Mine. Chairman Smith: “Allowing EPA to proceed in this pre-emptive fashion raises many concerns about the due process that should be afforded to those who apply for permits under the Clean Water Act. Moreover, it appears that the EPA will use this case as precedent to block additional projects throughout the United States. The negative impact this would have on the growth of the American economy is profound. “If we allow the EPA to pursue this path of action the agency will have the power to tell states, local governments, and even private citizens how they can develop their land before a permit application has ever been filed. This is unprecedented and dangerous.” In July 2014, EPA issued a determination using the Clean Water Act to limit development of the Pebble Mine before it had applied for any permits. On October 6, 2015, a report was released by the Cohen Group that raised questions about the fairness and biased nature of EPA’s use of the Clean Water Act with regard to the Pebble Mine. The Cohen report found that EPA employees may have had inappropriate contact with outside stakeholders opposed to Pebble Mine and arrived at a predetermined conclusion before any scientific evidence was gathered regarding the impacts of the Pebble Mine. The report also found that these employees were instrumental in preparing the scientific assessment that EPA used as a basis for its determination. The Committee heard from the lead author of the report on its findings. Witnesses today outlined what they described as a “massive” lobbying and public relations campaign and collusion between the EPA and outside groups to halt the Pebble Mine. Members questioned witnesses on several emails obtained by the Committee showing this collusion. In one example, EPA’s Bristol Bay project lead represented to opponents of the mine that while the EPA’s decision to block development “would be based on science – politics are as big or bigger factor.” The Committee obtained numerous examples of similar exchanges that show predetermined conclusions by EPA employees. To better understand the EPA’s process, the Committee has requested a transcribed interview with Region 10 EPA Administrator Dennis McLerran. Staff will be meeting with him next week. Chairman Smith also said today that the Committee will schedule a follow-up hearing in the coming weeks to hear directly from EPA on these allegations. Witness List: Panel 1 The Honorable William S. Cohen, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Cohen Group Mr. Charles Scheeler, Senior Counsel, DLA Piper Panel 2 Mr. Tom Collier, Chief Executive Officer, Pebble Limited Partnership Hon. Rick Halford, Former Alaska Senate President For more information about today’s hearing, including witness testimony and the hearing webcast, please visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
11.05.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting once more in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016. If passed by the Senate the bill would be sent to President Obama, who vetoed a previous version of the bill. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Today I voted once more to support those who go to work every day to protect America. It is time for the president to put away his political agenda and stand with us in support of our troops. They have waited long enough for this legislation. In the House we will continue to pass this defense bill as many times as it takes to provide our men and women in uniform with the resources they need and the benefits they have earned.”
11.03.2015	WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to reports of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo that shows officials have been planning to circumvent a Texas federal judge’s order halting President Obama’s executive immigration actions from last November. Congressman Lamar Smith: “No one, least of all those streaming illegally across our borders, believes that the Obama administration is going to enforce current immigration laws. If this administration was half as determined to uphold immigration laws as it is to undermining them, our borders would be secure, sanctuary cities would cease to exist, and criminal immigrants would be deported instead of being released back into our neighborhoods. This memo shows the great lengths to which DHS officials have gone in order to defy a federal judge’s orders that halted President Obama’s executive actions from last November. The American people cannot and will not tolerate this administration ignoring the rule of law. It is the only thing that protects the people and distinguishes our democracy from a dictatorship.” Other recent reports show that a majority of those illegally entering the U.S. through the Southern border said they came as a direct result of the Obama administration’s policies that would allow them to stay and receive benefits.
10.29.2015	WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after the Republican nominee for Speaker, Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), was chosen over Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to lead the House of Representatives. Congressman Lamar Smith: “House Republicans, including the Texas Republican delegation and the House Freedom Caucus, have united behind Rep. Ryan because he will provide the conservative leadership we need to enact reforms and get the people’s work done. No one has tried harder to restore fiscal responsibility in our nation’s capital and put our country on the path to prosperity. As Speaker, he will seek to serve the needs of the American people, not his own agenda. “I will continue working to secure our borders, balance our budget, and rein in an out-of-control EPA that is strangling our economy with regulations. We must halt the extreme agenda of this out-of-control administration.”
10.28.2015	WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted against a deal to raise the debt limit to $19.6 trillion with no ceiling. Congressman Lamar Smith: “This budget deal is irresponsible and represents Washington at its worst. “It abandons spending caps, increases the nation’s deficit, and puts no ceiling on raising the debt limit. “The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires Congress to put caps on federal spending that have resulted in a three-year decrease in spending for the first time in 60 years. This deal raises the budget caps by $112 billion over the next two years and adds to the deficit. Rather than increase spending, I favor a balanced budget. “The American people want Washington to get its economic house in order and live within its means. But the budget bill mortgages our future. This deal will take our national debt from $19 trillion to almost $20 trillion, further slowing economic growth. “This deal contains no specific debt limit. It allows President Obama and the next president to borrow as much money as they want through March 2017. “The bill was introduced late Monday night and voted upon Wednesday afternoon. It violates the spirit of the House rule that gives the American people and their representatives three days to read and consider major legislation.”
10.27.2015	WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted against a procedural measure known as a discharge petition that would move forward with reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank without allowing for amendments or reforms. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I support free and fair trade, and I have supported reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank in the past. But today’s vote did not follow regular legislative procedure and did not give members of Congress the opportunity to improve or reform the Bank. I cannot support reauthorization without substantial reforms. To do so ignores new disturbing reports. “One former loan officer pled guilty to 19 separate accounts of bribery. Four other employees were suspended for similarly questionable acts and improperly awarding contracts. We now know that almost 800 claims of fraud involving the Bank have been reported and 124 investigations were initiated by the bank’s Office of Inspector General. “I am pleased that Texas leads in American exports while receiving very little assistance from the Export-Import Bank. From 2009 to 2014, the Export-Import Bank supported only one-half of one percent of Texas exporters and only one-third of one percent of small businesses. I will continue my efforts against the real obstacles to job creation that Texans face: a mounting pile of federal regulations and a burdensome tax code that kills American jobs and threatens our competitiveness in a global economy. “When the bank uses taxpayer funding to help a foreign company buy an American-made product, that same company gains an advantage over American businesses. For example, the Air Line Pilots Association estimates that the bank’s support for just two foreign airlines – Emirates and Air India – has eliminated roughly 7,500 airline jobs here in the U.S. “My vote today reflects the voices of many constituents who share these concerns about the Export-Import Bank.”
10.27.2015	Washington, D.C. – The House of Representatives today unanimously approved the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act (READ Act) (H.R. 3033), a bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus. The Caucus is comprised of over 100 Members of Congress and is dedicated to increasing public awareness about dyslexia and ensuring all students have equal educational opportunities. Dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and one in six Americans in some form. Rep. Smith: “Despite the prevalence of dyslexia, many Americans remain undiagnosed, untreated and silently struggle at school or work. Too many children undiagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in the classroom and sometimes drop out of school and face uncertain futures. Today we can shine a light on dyslexia and help millions of Americans have a brighter and more prosperous future. We need to enable those with dyslexia to achieve their maximum potential. The READ Act will help accomplish this.” “I also have had the pleasure of meeting an Austin, Texas, resident Robbi Cooper and her son Ben. They shared many stories with me about the hardships they have faced in their attempts to ensure Ben receives the best education possible. Ben has even taken his abilities one step further by becoming an advocate and has traveled to D.C. numerous times to lobby Congress so others can learn from his experiences.” Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) discusses expected passage of the READ Act with Austin-based dyslexia advocates Robbi Cooper and son Ben before doing an interview on the importance of the READ Act. Robbi and Ben Cooper were able to join Rep. Smith in the House chamber for passage of the READ Act. The READ Act supports important research to further our understanding of dyslexia, including better methods for early detection and teacher training. The bill passed out of Committee on October 8, 2015 with unanimous support. While the READ Act does not increase federal spending, it requires the president’s annual budget request to Congress to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation (NSF). It also requires the NSF to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research, which would focus on best practices in the following areas: Early identification of children and students with dyslexia Professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators Curricula development and evidence-based educational tools for children with dyslexia The READ Act authorizes multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia research projects using funds appropriated for the NSF Research and Related Activities account and the Education and Human Resources Directorate.

10.23.2015	WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in favor of H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I remain dedicated to dismantling ObamaCare because it remains just as harmful to Texans as it was when it was first rammed through Congress five years ago. The House has already taken multiple votes to repeal, replace and dismantle ObamaCare, yet the Senate has been hindered from taking similar action because of its outdated 60-vote requirement. Today’s vote allows us to finally move past Senate rules and strip ObamaCare measures from the congressional budget. In addition this bill takes funding from Planned Parenthood and gives it to community health centers that provide care for women’s health. And finally, it reduces our deficit by almost $130 billion. These are the kinds of strong actions we must continue to take in order to rein in an out-of-control Obama administration.” Despite rising health care costs and ObamaCare’s unpopularity, Republicans in the Senate have lacked the 60 votes necessary to vote on repeal of ObamaCare measures, among other things. Just weeks ago, Smith was joined by almost 60 colleagues in calling for changes to Senate rules to do away with the 60 vote threshold for purposes of “consequential” legislation. According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, under ObamaCare the cost of insurance in Texas has increased by 79 percent for the average 27-year-old man, and 54 percent for the average 40-year-old man. The average 27-year-old woman has seen increases of 29 percent and the average 64-year-old woman’s insurance has increased by 18 percent.
10.22.2015	WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today condemned President Obama’s veto of H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The president’s actions came after weeks of threats, despite the fact that the bill passed in both the House and the Senate with broad bipartisan support. Congressman Lamar Smith: “This is a historic day for all the wrong reasons. In the last 35 years, there have been only four other times when a president has vetoed funding for our military. Today, President Obama drew a big red line in the sand, not against America’s enemies, but against the very men and women who have sworn to protect and defend us. This bill was approved by bipartisan majorities of the House and Senate. It provides our troops with the resources and training they need as well as support for active duty military transitioning into veteran status.” The president’s veto has been widely criticized. A Wall Street Journal editorial equated the president’s veto threat to “taking the U.S. military hostage” and a Washington Post editorial chided the president for seeking to make history “but not in a good way.” In the vetoed bill, Congress provided the exact amount of funding requested by the Obama administration. The 21st Congressional District is home to over 60,000 veterans, current members of the military and their families.
10.09.2015	WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in favor of House passage of H.R. 702, legislation that removes the nearly 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports. Congressman Smith: “Texas has played a key role in the growth of America’s energy economy. Today, I voted in support of our energy economy and the jobs it creates in Texas. Ending the ban on crude exports means more American energy jobs and more American energy security.” Lifting the ban will: Generate $1.4 billion in profits to the federal government over the next 10 years from federal mineral royalties, according to Congressional Budget Office. This increase production will also increase state level revenues from increased oil production on federal, state, and private lands. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congressional Budget Office, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas all agree that lifting the ban is likely to lower the price of gasoline and diesel fuel for American consumers. Create an estimated 394,000 additional U.S. jobs over the 2016-2030 period, with a peak of 964,000 in 2018, according to IHS.
10.08.2015	Washington, D.C. - The president this week signed into law the STEM Education Act of 2015 (H.R. 1020), a bipartisan bill introduced by Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas). The bill strengthens science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education efforts and expands the definition of STEM to include computer science. The bill recently was approved unanimously by both the House and the Senate. Chairman Smith: “We must prepare our students for degrees in STEM subjects to ensure that they have the ability to thrive in today’s technology-based economy. This means motivating more American students to study STEM subjects, including computer science. Unfortunately, America lags behind many other nations when it comes to STEM education. American students rank 21st in science and 26th in math. “The STEM Education Act expands the definition of STEM, encourages students to study these subjects and trains more teachers. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work getting this important bipartisan bill on the president’s desk.” The STEM Education Act of 2015 directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to continue to award competitive merit-reviewed grants to support informal STEM education. Informal education is work that takes place outside of the classroom at places like museums, science centers and afterschool programs. These types of efforts engage students in STEM subjects and fields in ways that formal classroom training often does not. The bill amends the NSF Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship program to allow teachers in pursuit of Master’s degrees to participate in the program. This would allow more teachers the opportunity to compete for the grants. Computer science is also added as a subject for the scholarship program. No new or additional spending is authorized in the bill.
10.01.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting against a continuing resolution that would have provided taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, which is under congressional investigation as a result of recent controversial videos. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The House has been entrusted with the power of the purse. To the best of our ability, we must ensure that every dime of taxpayer’s dollars is used in a manner consistent with the values and views of the American people. I have heard from many constituents who are as disturbed as I am by the gruesome Planned Parenthood videos. I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of funding that continues to support this controversial organization, which appears to have engaged in trafficking of unborn baby body parts and performed procedures similar to partial-birth abortions, both of which are illegal.”
10.01.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in support of the final conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016, which authorizes funding for the Department of Defense. Congressman Smith: “National security is a top concern for many Americans. In today’s world, we are constantly reminded of the need to maintain a strong military in the hopes that we will never have to use it. Congress has a sacred responsibility to provide for our nation’s defense. We must never forget the sacrifices those who serve make to protect our freedom. Today I voted to ensure our men and women in uniform have the resources they need.” The funding in the bill is consistent with the House Budget Resolution that balances the federal budget and ensures troop readiness through rigorous training, adequate facilities and well-maintained equipment. It supports a 1.3% percent pay raise for the military and includes a new retirement benefit for 83 percent of troops that currently receive nothing. The bill also supports the transition of troops from active-duty into veteran status by directing DoD and the VA to work in cooperation on pain management and other health issues of the 21st century. It also provides for lethal assistance to Ukraine and a plan to address Russia’s unconventional warfare methods. In March, Rep. Smith attested to Fort Sam Houston’s importance to the San Antonio community before a public Army Listening Session.
10.01.2015	Washington, D.C. - The House of Representatives today unanimously cleared the STEM Education Act (H.R. 1020), a bipartisan bill introduced by Science, Space, and Technology Committee Lamar Smith (R-Texas). The bill strengthens ongoing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education efforts at federal science agencies and ensures computer science is included in these efforts as a subject that builds on the traditional STEM subjects. The bill now heads to the president’s desk for signature and enactment.Chairman Smith: “A well-educated and trained STEM workforce ensures our future economic prosperity. This means motivating more American students to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A healthy STEM workforce that is literate in all STEM subjects, including computer science, is critical to America’s ability to create jobs and compete in the world. This important bipartisan legislation that will help prepare our students to thrive in a technology-based economy.” Summary of Major Provisions in the STEM Education Act of 2015: Expands existing federal grants and programs related to STEM education to include computer science education. Supports competitive merit-reviewed grants for informal STEM education, which is learning outside of the classroom at places like museums, science centers, and afterschool programs. Amends the National Science Foundation Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship program to allow teachers in pursuit of a master’s degree to apply for the grant and explicitly include computer science teachers. The STEM Education Act would allow more teachers the opportunity to compete for the grant, better reflecting the current reality facing our schools, especially in high-need areas.
09.30.2015	Washington, D.C. - The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology today held a hearing to examine the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia (READ) Act (H.R. 3033), a bipartisan bill introduced by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to prioritize research and development to overcome dyslexia. Dr. Rachel Robillard, who oversees the Austin Independent School District’s Dyslexia Services program, was among witnesses testifying at today’s hearing. She is also a member of the College of Education faculty at both the University of Texas at Austin and Texas State University in San Marcos. Video of Chairman Smith’s opening statement can be found here, and Dr. Robillard’s testimony can be found here. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) with Texas-based dyslexia advocates Robbi Cooper and Dr. Rachel Robillard of Austin, and Lyn Pollard of Dallas. Chairman Smith: “Dyslexia is the most common reading disability yet those who suffer from it often have normal or above-average intelligence. Many Americans remain undiagnosed, untreated and silently struggle at school or work. If you can’t read, it is hard to achieve. The READ Act is a step in the right direction. I have to end with a little bit of a plug for the state of Texas because I think we’re a little bit ahead of the curve—we’re certainly ahead of a number of other states because of legislation that has been passed.” Dr. Rachel Robillard: “I strongly encourage support for the READ act. Having specified annual funds devoted to dyslexia research that focuses on best practices in early identification, professional development for teachers and administrators, and curriculum development and evidence-based educational tools for children with dyslexia can only improve the opportunities of all students to have access to an education that allows each of them to learn to read. “We are fortunate in the state of Texas to have a strong support for our dyslexic students. The State Dyslexia Handbook is the guide for public schools in Texas as to how to identify and teach dyslexic students. Texas has a long history of supporting the teaching of reading that includes a focus on early identification and intervention for children who experience reading difficulties. We do not want to wait until students need the intervention in order to not fail and drop out. What we want for our students in Texas, and all of the United States, is the ability to identify and intervene with these students early and well.” Dyslexia is a difficulty to read fluently and with accurate comprehension. Dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and one in six Americans in some form. Many children undiagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in the classroom. October is National Dyslexia Awareness Month. Smith serves as a bipartisan co-chair of the Congressional Dyslexia Caucus. In July, Smith introduced the READ Act. While the READ Act does not increase federal spending, it authorizes multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia research projects using existing funds appropriated for the NSF Research and Related Activities account and the Education and Human Resources Directorate. It also requires the NSF to conduct dyslexia research which would focus on best practices in the following areas: Early identification of children and students with dyslexia Professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators Curricula development and evidence-based educational tools for children with dyslexia The following witnesses testified: Ms. Barbara Wilson, Co-Founder and President, Wilson Language Training Dr. Paula Tallal, Senior Research Scientist, Center for Human Development, University of California, San Diego; Adjunct Professor, Salk Institute for Biological Studies; Founder and Director, Scientific Learning Corporation Dr. Rachel Robillard, Assistant Director, 504 Services and Response to Intervention, Austin Independent School District For more information about today’s hearing, including witness testimony and the archived webcast, visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
09.24.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement as he welcomed Texans to the U.S. Capitol for the visit of Pope Francis. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Today I welcomed dozens of Texans to Washington for Pope Francis’ visit and address to Congress. His message of hope and love is one that resonates with many people across different faiths. It is appropriate the pope’s visit occurs at a time when our country faces crucial moral questions about the sanctity of life and the kind of society we want to leave to our children.” Smith was joined by several dozen Texans who responded to an open invitation to join him in Washington for the Pope’s visit. Rev. Father Jimmy Drennan of Saint Margaret Mary’s Catholic Church in San Antonio prays a blessing over attendees at a lunch hosted by Rep. Lamar Smith following Pope Francis’ address. Robin and Sam Cowsar of Fredericksburg speak with San Antonio reporter Annette Garcia at a lunch hosted by Rep. Lamar Smith following Pope Francis’ address. Rep. Smith speaks to constituents who traveled to Washington from Texas to hear Pope Francis’ address. ### Congressman Smith represents the 21st District of Texas. He serves as chairman of the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee, and is a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and the House Judiciary Committee, on which he also served as chairman. He is also founder and chairman of the House Border Security Caucus and has previously been named the most effective lawmaker in Congress.
09.18.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted to halt federal funding for Planned Parenthood and instead fund community health clinics that offer women’s health services but not abortions. Smith also voted in favor of legislation providing protection and care for survivors of abortions. He is a cosponsor of both bills. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Last year, Planned Parenthood received half a billion dollars in taxpayer funding. Several videos have brought to light multiple questionable and gruesome practices. No organization that may have taken illegal actions should receive hard-earned taxpayer dollars. The funds should go instead to community health clinics that do not perform abortions. “This week, the House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, also heard testimony from several witnesses who miraculously survived abortions. The Born Alive Infant Protection Act ensures that children born alive after an abortion attempt receive the same care as any other child born under different circumstances.” Videos of Planned Parenthood executives that surfaced over the past few months raised questions of whether the tax-exempt group has been engaging in illegal activity: trafficking fetal body parts, and performing abortion procedures similar to outlawed partial-birth abortions in order to harvest organs. In addition to the ongoing congressional investigation, Smith has joined 133 House colleagues in calling for a formal Department of Justice investigation into the questionable Planned Parenthood activities. A long-time opponent of federal funding being used for abortions, Smith has received recognition from the National Right to Life for his pro-life record and support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban all abortions after 20 weeks. A map released this week showed the dramatic difference funding more than 13,000 community health clinics could make, as opposed to just the 665 Planned Parenthood locations; there are currently 20 comprehensive clinics where women can receive care for every one Planned Parenthood. In 2012, Texas stopped funding abortion-providers like Planned Parenthood. Instead, in 2013 it created the Women’s Health Program, which provides low-income women with family planning services, health screenings and birth control. According to a study by George Washington University, this resulted in community clinics increasing their women’s health care services by an average of 81 percent.
09.17.2015	Washington, DC — Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was joined by 56 House colleagues today in sending a letter to Senate leadership asking to dispense with the 60-vote threshold that has thus far prevented Senate disapproval of President Obama’s Iran Deal. The letter reads: “As Members of the House of Representatives, we respectfully urge the Senate to modify its rules to a majority vote threshold of 51 senators to approve some legislation. Some pieces of legislation, like the Iran nuclear deal, are simply so consequential that they demand revisions to the Senate’s procedures. … “Our request to eliminate the filibuster for some votes simply underscores that in a democracy the majority should decide. The super-majority now required to advance legislation is 60 votes, which is not serving our country well.” A recent Pew Research Center poll indicates that only 21 percent of the public supports the Iran deal. Last week, the House passed legislation asserting that the deal should not go forward due to President Obama’s failure to comply with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 which required that all details be submitted to Congress. Although details of secret side deals have not been submitted to Congress, the Obama administration is treating today as the end of a 60-day congressional review deadline. In addition to Smith, the following Members signed onto the letter: Blake Farenthold (TX-27) Randy Neugebauer (TX-19) Brian Babin (TX-36) Pete Sessions (TX-32) Morgan Griffith (VA-9) Roger Williams (TX-25) Bruce Westerman (AR-4) Randy Weber (TX-14) Bill Flores (TX-17) John Carter (TX-31) Mo Brooks (AL-5) Michael Burgess (TX-26) Matt Salmon (AZ-5) Leonard Lance (NJ-7) Mick Mulvaney (SC-5) Vicki Hartzler (MO-4) John Culberson (TX-7) Louie Gohmert (TX-1) Doug Collins (GA-9) Jeff Duncan (SC-3) Tom Reed (NY-23) Mike McCaul (TX-10) Steve Pearce (NM-2) Daniel Webster (FL-10) Bill Shuster (PA-9) Chris Stewart (UT-2) Trent Franks (AZ-8) John Ratcliffe (TX-4) Raul Labrador (ID-1) Paul Gosar (AZ-4) Kevin Cramer (ND-At Large) Joe Wilson (SC-2) Mark Amodei (NV-2) Steven Palazzo (MS-4) Ralph Abraham (LA-5) Luke Messer (IN-6) Doug Lamborn (CO-5) Bob Goodlatte (VA-6) Kevin Brady (TX-8) Sam Johnson (TX-3) Ted Poe (TX-2) Mike Bishop (MI-8) Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-5) Steve Chabot (OH-1) Tom Marino (PA-10) Barry Loudermilk (GA-11) Kenny Marchant (TX-24) Steve King (IA-4) Jeb Hensarling (TX-5) Robert Aderholt (AL-4) Jeff Fortenberry (NE-1) Robert Pittenger (NC-9) Andy Harris (MD-1) Marlin Stutzman (IN-3) Frank LoBiondo (NJ-2) Cynthia Lummis (WY-At Large) Full text of Smith’s letter can be found here.
09.17.2015	The House of Representatives today passed legislation authored by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) H.R. 758, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (LARA) by a vote of 241-185. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) joined Smith in praising the legislation that will reduce frivolous lawsuits in the United States. The bill imposes mandatory sanctions on attorneys who file baseless lawsuits in federal courts. Congressman Smith: “Frivolous lawsuits have become too common. Lawyers who bring these cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose under current rules, which permit plaintiffs’ lawyers to file frivolous suits, no matter how absurd the claims, without any penalty. Meanwhile defendants are often faced with years of litigation and substantial attorneys’ fees. LARA restores accountability to our legal system by reinstating mandatory sanctions for attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits.” Chairman Goodlatte: “Frivolous lawsuits have no place in the American courtroom, and current loopholes allow too many lawyers to take advantage of innocent victims. Current laws allow lawyers to file baseless claims, and pass legal costs on to the victims who have no guarantee of compensation for the injury they suffered. That’s why the passage of LARA is essential to end lawsuit abuse. LARA guarantees that victims are fully compensated for harm done by filers of frivolous lawsuits in federal courts. “Today Congress took a stand against attorneys who prey on weak victims just for the satisfaction of making a quick dollar in our judicial system.” Background: LARA restores accountability to our legal system by penalizing lawyers for filing baseless lawsuits. The bill specifically ensures that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits, including the attorney’s fees and costs incurred by the victim of the frivolous lawsuit; and reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow attorneys to make frivolous claims without penalty by withdrawing them within 21 days. LARA supports innocent Americans who are victims of frivolous lawsuits: LARA makes mandatory that victims of frivolous lawsuits be compensated for harm done to them by filers of frivolous lawsuits. LARA is even-handed: LARA applies to cases brought by individuals as well as businesses both large and small. The bill also applies to both plaintiffs and defendants. LARA ends the “free pass” for lawyers: The bill eliminates the 21-day “free pass” for lawyers to file frivolous pleadings. Current federal rules allow lawyers to file frivolous pleadings without any sanctions as long as they withdraw those pleadings within 21 days, even if the victims of the frivolous lawsuit had to spend time and money responding to the frivolous pleadings. LARA protects states’ rights: LARA only applies to federal court and does not change state court rules.
09.16.2015	Washington, D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to an announcement that NASA will be forced to delay the development of the Orion crew vehicle. Last year the administration also delayed the development of the Space Launch System. Both of these systems are being developed for deep space human exploration. Chairman Lamar Smith: “Once again, the Obama administration is choosing to delay deep space exploration priorities such as Orion and the Space Launch System that will take U.S. astronauts to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. While this administration has consistently cut funding for these programs and delayed their development, Congress has consistently restored funding as part of our commitment to maintaining American leadership in space. We must chart a compelling course for our nation’s space program so that we can continue to inspire future generations of scientists, engineers and explorers. I urge this administration to follow the lead of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee’s NASA Authorization Act to fully fund NASA’s exploration programs.” In April, Smith hosted Apollo astronaut and Kerrville resident Gene Cernan at the U.S. Capitol to address fellow lawmakers about the importance of American leadership in space exploration and show a screening of a documentary on Cernan’s life. Cernan was the last person to walk on the Moon more than forty years ago. NASA announced today that its schedule for the first crewed mission of SLS and Orion will slip to 2023; this represents a two year slip from previous plans for the first mission by 2021. The agency announced similar delays last fall. Smith has repeatedly criticized the Obama administration for failure to request adequate funding for Orion and the Space Launch System; the administration’s FY16 budget request proposed cuts of more than $440 million for the programs while earth science accounts have increased by 63 percent during the past eight years. Thirteen agencies do climate research, but only one conducts space exploration. The House Science Committee’s NASA Authorization Act for 2016 and 2017 provided NASA with a balanced, budget-neutral plan that prioritized crucial programs being developed to return U.S. astronauts to deep space destinations such as the Moon and Mars.
09.15.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today circulated a letter to colleagues calling for a change in Senate rules to dispense with the 60-vote threshold that recently prevented Senate disapproval of President Obama’s Iran Deal. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Republicans need to go on offense and set the agenda. The future of America is being held hostage by a few Democrats in the Senate. It is time to restore the fundamental principle of democracy-the majority rules. The Obama administration is using the filibuster to torture the Constitution, undermine the rule of law and ignore the will of the people. “The American people sent us to Congress to represent their interests and to take actions that benefit our great nation. Yet, time and again we hear from our constituents that Congress either isn’t listening or is incapable of performing its basic responsibilities as a legislature. “A bad Iran nuclear deal merits the use of the Senate’s so-called nuclear option. I respect the separate rules and role of the Senate and do not advocate this change for every small matter. But for the sake of American national security interests we must place every available option on the table to stop this bad Iran deal. Had a simple majority rule been in place this week, both chambers of Congress could have voiced their strong disapproval of the Iran deal. It is time to send a strong signal to this administration that it can no longer disregard the will of the American people and their representatives in Congress.” Smith plans to send the letter to Senate leadership later this week. Text of the letter can be found below. The Honorable Mitch McConnell The Honorable Harry Reid Senate Majority Leader Senate Minority Leader S-230, The Capitol S-221, The Capitol Washington, DC 201510 Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, As Members of the House of Representatives, we respectfully urge the Senate to modify its rules to a majority vote threshold of 51 senators to approve some legislation. Some pieces of legislation, like the Iran nuclear deal, are simply so consequential that they demand revisions to the Senate’s procedures. The American people sent us to Congress to represent their interests and to take actions that benefit our great nation. Yet, time and again we hear from our constituents that Congress either isn’t listening or is incapable of performing its basic responsibilities as a legislature. Our request to eliminate the filibuster for some votes simply underscores that in a democracy the majority should decide. The super-majority now required to advance legislation is 60 votes, which is not serving our country well. We are under no illusion that the elimination of the Senate filibuster for some votes will guarantee the passage of legislation much less its enactment into law. However, a move by the Senate to a majority vote that can approve some legislation would make it much easier for Congress to advance meaningful solutions to challenges our country faces. Thank you for your consideration of our request. We stand ready to work with you and your Senate colleagues to improve our legislative process. Sincerely,
09.11.2015	Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX): “The Obama administration ignored the outcry from stakeholders and the American public when it issued the final rule on its Power Plan.The Clean Air Act was never intended to regulate carbon. It is well documented that the final plan will shut down power plants across the country, increase electricity prices and cost thousands of Americans their jobs. My home state of Texas would be one of the hardest hit. The state would be forced to close affordable coal-fired power plants, which also provide reliable electricity during peak usage times in the summer. This rule represents massive costs without significant benefits. In other words, it’s all pain and no gain.” The Obama administration is preparing final steps before implementing the rule to regulate carbon emissions from power plants, which could happen as early as October. Dr. Shaw: “As the leader of this agency, my job is to ensure we carry out our mission to mitigate environmental risks, while basing all of our regulations on sound science and compliance with state and federal statutes. In every case where Texas disagrees with EPA’s actions, it is because EPA’s actions are not consistent with these principles. “The rule is still riddled with technical flaws that make it impractical and/or impossible to implement, and the EPA has not given states, especially Texas, nearly enough time to formulate and submit a state plan. And all this when even the EPA acknowledges that this rule will not have a single discernible impact on climate change or sea level rise. I would be derelict in my duty to protect the TCEQ’s mission if I did not make plain this Rule’s shortcomings.” The final regulation released by EPA on August 3rd created emissions requirements with more stringent emissions guidelines for states that rely most heavily on fossil energy for electricity.

09.11.2015	Click here or on the photo above for video from Rep. Smith’s remarks on the House floor. Congressman Lamar Smith: “This week is a somber week for our nation. September 11th reminds us of the sacred responsibility we in Congress have to protect the American people from those who want to kill us. That is why we must oppose the Iran deal. This deal only emboldens our enemies at the expense of our friends and our own national security. So it is no surprise that a majority in Congress oppose the deal, for many reasons. “First, it allows Iran to develop nuclear weapons in the future. In other words, Iran would not even have to cheat on the agreement to obtain a nuclear bomb. “Second, it frees up as much as $150 billion in assets for Iran. These funds inevitably will be used by Iran to export terrorism, as the president himself has admitted. “Third, the long-standing arms embargo against Iran will be lifted. This enables Iran to acquire weapons that could be used against our allies. In fact, Iran plans to buy long-range surface-to-air missiles from Russia by the end of the year. “Fourth, there is no credible way to conduct inspections of Iran’s nuclear weapons-building sites. Under the proposed deal, Iran is given weeks, if not months, of advance notice of any inspection. This provides ample time and opportunity for Iran to hide evidence of nuclear weapons activities and violate the agreement. Secret deals that the administration hid from Congress and the American people have now been revealed. One secret deal permits Iran to conduct its own inspections at a military facility suspected of ties to nuclear weapons. I am glad that the House is taking action to disapprove of the Iran deal. But the 60-day window for considering this deal has not begun until Congress has received all documents involved in this deal. “Finally, this deal endangers Israel, one of our oldest and strongest allies. No other nation is at more risk of a nuclear attack from Iran than Israel. By increasing the odds of a nuclear Iran, this deal directly threatens the security and future of Israel. “Remember, this is not the law of the land. This deal is a non-binding executive agreement. Only the Constitution is the law of the land. The Iran deal destabilizes the Middle East, jeopardizes America’s security, and endangers the world. The Iran deal must be opposed now and in the future.”
09.10.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today following a United States District Court for the District of Columbia’s ruling in United States House of Representatives v. Burwell, the House’s litigation challenging President Obama’s unilateral transfer of funds to insurance companies. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I am encouraged by today’s ruling. Americans are tired of this executive branch going around their representatives in Congress to rewrite and undermine laws. We will continue exercising our constitutional duty to guard the rule of law, which is the heart of our democracy.” The Court ruled today that “The House of Representatives has standing to pursue its allegations that the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and of the Treasury violated Article I, § 9, cl. 7 of the Constitution when they spent public monies that were not appropriated by the Congress.”
09.09.2015	Washington D.C. – Today Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) convened the first congressional hearing to examine the actions that took place at the Gold King Mine in Colorado on August 5th that led to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spilling over three million gallons of toxic wastewater into the Animas River. Click here or on the photo above to watch Chairman Smith’s opening statement. Chairman Smith: “The EPA should be held accountable. The same standards that the EPA applies to private companies should also apply to the EPA itself. The EPA’s negligence is especially inexcusable since there were known procedures that could have prevented the river’s pollution. This Committee asked for information from the EPA almost a month ago and we have yet to receive all the documents that were requested. Given the EPA’s consistent failure to provide information to this Committee and the American people, the EPA can be assured that our oversight efforts will continue.” The Committee today heard directly from the EPA and its private contractor that was working on the mine at the time of the spill as well as local officials and a representative from the Navajo Nation who was impacted by the spill. The toxic spill was so substantial that it traveled nearly 300 miles through Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, to Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border. The wastewater contained lead, arsenic, thallium and other heavy metals that may cause health problems and harm aquatic life. Many questions have been raised about the timeliness of EPA’s communications with state and local officials immediately following the spill. In some instances, the appropriate authorities were not notified of the spill until 24 hours after the incident. EPA was also slow to provide the public and the House Science Committee with information about the accident. Members today questioned apparent varying standards EPA holds itself to, compared to if this spill had been caused by a private company. To date, no individual has been held responsible and EPA has yet to admit any negligence. Yet witnesses today said that EPA officials knew the potential for a blowout of toxic wastewater from the mine more than a year before the spill occurred. Witnesses also highlighted concerns over direct conflict of interest with EPA investigating a spill that the agency caused. Members today also questioned EPA’s attempt to cover up its lack of preparedness at the scene of the spill, despite warnings issued prior to the spill. In response to a Committee letter specifically requesting videos from the spill, the EPA posted footage online with a disclaimer on their website that reads: “EPA removed profanity contained in the audio of the videos and obscured visible license plates for privacy purposes. EPA did not edit the videos in any other way.” However, EPA censored the last few seconds of a video where the team on the ground appeared to attempt to flee the scene and asked, “What do we do now?” The following witnesses testified today: The Honorable Mathy Stanislaus, Assistant Administrator, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Environmental Protection Agency Mr. Dennis Greaney, President, Environmental Restoration LLC The Honorable Donald Benn, Executive Director, Navajo National Environmental Protection Agency The Honorable Dean Bookie, Mayor, Durango, Colorado Dr. Mark Williamson, Geochemist, Geochemical Solutions LLC For more information about the hearing, including witness testimony and a link to the webcast, please visit the Committee’s website.
09.08.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today spoke out on the House floor in opposition to the Iran deal being considered before Congress. Smith is an original cosponsor of the resolution of disapproval of the Iran nuclear agreement that the House will vote on this week. In May of this year, Smith also voted in favor of H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which was intended to give Congress and the American people the final say on any deal with Iran. Congressman Lamar Smith: “This much we know about the Iran deal: it permits Iran to develop nuclear weapons in the future. It means $150 billion to Iran, some of which will be used to export terrorism, as president Obama has admitted. It allows Iran to buy weapons, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles. It gives Iran weeks, if not months, of advanced notice of any weapons site inspections. It includes secret side agreements. One prohibits other countries from inspecting a possible nuclear weapons development site. “The Iran deal destabilizes the Middle East, jeopardizes America’s security and endangers the world.” Click here or on the photo above for video from Rep. Smith’s remarks on the House floor.
09.04.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today held the first meeting with members of a newly-formed Military and Veterans Council, which includes representatives from across the 21st congressional district. Congressman Smith: “The 21st congressional district is home to more than 60,000 veterans, current members of the military and their families. The debt we owe them can never fully be repaid. But the best way we can thank them is by ensuring they receive the care and services they were promised. In Congress we have worked to improve benefits and care available to our service members and veterans. In addition, I feel it is extremely important to receive regular updates regarding the state of care and services our veterans and members of the military are receiving here at home. That is the purpose of this council. I thank each of them for their exemplary service to our country and willingness to serve as part of this advisory group.” Members of the Council were referred by their peers, member organizations, and local and state officials. A majority of the members attended today's meeting. They include: Kirby Allen (Bexar County) is a retired United States Air Force Colonel who has served as branch chief in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He has flown 242 combat missions. Rev. Von Seggern (Comal County) is a retired United States Air Force Colonel and Chaplain. Mike Reed (Kendall County) is a retired intelligence officer United States Air Force Colonel.

08.25.2015	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after the Environmental Protection Agency failed to provide documents and communication the Committee requested by August 24th concerning the agency’s involvement in the Gold King Mine spill. Chairman Lamar Smith: “It is disappointing, but not surprising, that the EPA failed to meet the House Science Committee’s reasonable deadline in turning over documents pertaining to the Gold King Mine spill. These documents are essential to the Committee’s ongoing investigation and our upcoming hearing on September 9th. But more importantly, this information matters to the many Americans directly affected in western states, who are still waiting for answers from the EPA. “Even in the face of self-imposed environmental disaster, this administration continues to prioritize its extreme agenda over the interests and well-being of Americans. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is currently crusading on climate change action in Japan while President Obama, who has yet to visit the areas affected by the spill, is touring the U.S. to tout EPA’s latest regulation that will do little to impact climate change and will only further burden Americans with higher electric bills. It is no wonder the majority of Americans feel Washington no longer works for them.” Chairman Smith first requested communication and documents from the EPA in an August 10th letter. Among other things, the Committee requested documents and materials relating to the work that caused the August 5th spill, and potential risks that chemicals and toxins could pose to animals and humans. While the EPA has publicly released some documents requested by the Committee, it has failed to turn over the majority of the requested documentation to date. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee has requested the presence of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and the president of EPA’s contractor, Environmental Restoration, LLC, to testify at a hearing on Wednesday September 9th at 10:00am ET.
08.21.2015	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today announced a Committee request for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy to testify at an upcoming hearing on the agency’s role in the Animas River spill. Chairman Lamar Smith: “After spilling millions of gallons of toxic chemicals into the Animas River, the EPA has an obligation to be forthcoming about what went wrong and potential long-term impacts on local communities. Weeks after the spill, families and businesses who depend on the Animas River continue to deal with uncertainty and limited information. As the agency entrusted by the American people to protect the environment and ensure the nation’s waters are clean, the EPA should be held to the highest standard. The Science Committee needs to hear from the EPA about steps it is taking to repair the damage and to prevent this from ever occurring again.” The Science, Space, and Technology Committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday September 9th at 10:00am ET to hear directly from the EPA about events that took place at the Gold King Mine in Colorado that led to the Animas River spill.
08.18.2015	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans for new regulations restricting methane emissions. The proposed rule would impose costly new restrictions on oil and natural gas, despite industry efforts that have already drastically reduced emissions in recent years. Chairman Lamar Smith: “The EPA's proposed methane rule is yet another example of the Obama administration's war on American energy jobs. The EPA's own data shows that methane emissions in the United States decreased by almost 15% between 1990 and 2013, yet EPA is forging ahead with this extraneous and unnecessary regulation. Instead of conspiring with extreme environmental interests, EPA should stop punishing cooperative industry stakeholders and start partnering with them in their current efforts to capture methane in a responsible manner. The EPA’s opposition to responsible, market-driven, ‘all-of-the-above’ domestic energy development is on full display with the announcement of this new regulation.” Smith has previously criticized the EPA’s release of rules in coordination with environmental stakeholders to the exclusion of energy industry stakeholders. At a July hearing, Committee members asked Administrator Gina McCarthy about the appearance of collusion with environmental groups such as the National Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters and Michael Goo, former Associate Administrator of the EPA Office of Policy. The emails included evidence that Mr. Goo shared draft documents with outside groups and urged them to write reports in support of EPA actions. Today’s rule also was announced alongside an Environmental Defense Fund report that pushes for increased methane regulations.
08.06.2015	A bill introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to rename a stretch of highway after a Medal of Honor recipient passed the Senate by Unanimous Consent and now heads to the president’s desk to be signed into law. The bill will rename part of I-10 in Kendall County in honor of PFC Milton A. Lee who died in combat in Vietnam on April 26, 1968, at the age of 19. Lee was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House in 1970 for ‘conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.’ He is buried at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio. Congressman Smith: “It is an honor to recognize Medal of Honor recipient Milton A. Lee for his service to our country. It was a special privilege to be able to work with local officials to honor a courageous soldier who gave his life for his countrymen. I am proud to represent over 65,000 veterans who probably know or served with someone like PFC Lee. It is most appropriate that Medal of Honor recipient Milton Lee have a section of IH-10 named for him near his ultimate resting place.” Background: PFC Lee served as a radio telephone operator with the 3rd platoon, Company B. during an intense, surprise hostile attack by North Vietnamese Army fighters. The 3rd platoon maneuvered to a position of cover to treat their wounded and reorganize. Meanwhile, PFC Lee moved through the heavy enemy fire to give lifesaving first aid to his wounded fellow soldiers. PFC Lee immediately and with great risk to his own personal safety, passed his radio to another soldier and charged through the barrage of fire. Without hesitation he continued his attack, and successfully overran the enemy position, killing all occupants and capturing 4 automatic weapons and a rocket launcher. PFC Lee continued his one-man assault on another enemy position through a heavy barrage of enemy automatic weapons fire. Although wounded, he continued to press the attack and crawled forward into a firing position to deliver accurate cover fire for his platoon. This enabled his platoon to maneuver and destroy the position. Not until the position was overrun did PFC Lee falter in his steady volume of fire and succumb to his wounds. PFC Lee's heroic actions saved the lives of many in his platoon and were instrumental in the destruction of a key position of the enemy’s defense. PFC Lee's gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty epitomizes the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on himself, the 502nd Infantry, and the U.S. Army. I would like to thank VFW Post 688, led by Quartermaster Bob Worrall, in Boerne for their help with this effort. I also thank all the Texas members in the House for co-sponsoring this bill and supporting efforts to properly remember the fallen heroes of our nation.

08.04.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined colleagues in submitting a resolution disapproving of the Iran nuclear agreement under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. In addition to the resolution, Smith also joined Congressman Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) and 91 colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama demanding the text of side deals with Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) be delivered to Congress. Congressman Smith: “The more we learn about the Obama administration’s Iran deal, the worse it sounds. This deal emboldens our enemies at the expense of our friends and our national security. It lifts the sanctions on Iran and lacks adequate enforcement measures. It puts sanction relief for Iran above the safety and security of Americans and our allies. This is why I voted earlier this spring to give Congress and the American people the final say. And that is why I join my colleagues in demanding details on secret side deals and in sending a strong message of disapproval of this deal.” The full text of the letter is below: August 4, 2015 The Honorable Barack Obama President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500 Mr. President: It has come to our attention that during the recent negotiation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, at least two side deals were made between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iran. These side deals, concerning the “roadmap for the clarification of past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear programs,” have not been made available to the United States Congress. One deal covers the Parchin military complex and the other covers prior military dimensions (PMDs) of Iran's nuclear program. This is no small matter. As you yourself have made clear, the agreement is “not based on trust, but on verification.” The issue of how we will verify that Iran is being truthful about its activities at potential nuclear sites will determine whether the JCPOA can ultimately succeed. Under the clear language of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which you signed into law, members of Congress are entitled to the text of these two side deals. Specifically, members have a right to all “annexes, appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing materials, documents, and guidance, technical or other understandings and any related agreements, whether entered into or implemented prior to the agreement or to be entered into or implemented in the future.” Congress’s legal right to these documents creates a corresponding legal obligation for your administration to provide them for our review. The JCPOA with Iran is a matter of immense importance to the immediate and long-term security of the United States. Members of Congress have the right and the duty to review every relevant document, every term, and every word of this agreement in order to make an informed decision about whether or not it merits our support. We request that you provide the text of these side deals to Congress as expeditiously as possible. If you do not possess these documents, we request that you immediately secure them from the IAEA and then provide them to Congress. We look forward to your quick reply. Sincerely,
08.03.2015	Washington D.C. – Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after the president announced the EPA’s final rule to regulate emissions from U.S. power plants. The final rule goes a step further than drafts issued in 2013 and last summer, mandating power plants cut an average of 32 percent of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. The rule is estimated to cost Americans $8.4 billion annually, making it one of the most costly rules of all time. Chairman Smith: “Today the Obama administration ignored the outcry from stakeholders and the American public in issuing the final rule on its Power Plan. The Obama administration continues to force costly and unnecessary regulations on hardworking American families. The Clean Air Act was never intended to regulate carbon. Yet the president and his Environmental Protection Agency are sidestepping Congress to push their extreme environmental agenda. The final plan released today will shut down power plants across the country, increase electricity prices and cost thousands of Americans their jobs. And my home state of Texas would be one of the hardest hit. This rule goes well beyond the regulation of power plants, even reaching down into Americans’ homes to control electricity use. Higher energy prices means the price of everything will increase, and low-income families already struggling to make ends meet will be among those most burdened by this costly rule.” According to independent assessments from Energy Ventures Analysis, Inc., the EPA’s Power Plan will increase residential electric bills by 29 percent and gas bills by as much as 50 percent across the nation. In Texas, electric bills will increase by 48 percent and gas bills by 75 percent. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), has estimated the EPA’s plan could cause energy costs for consumers to increase by up to 20% in 2020.
07.31.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA), along with 26 other members of Congress, today sent a bi-partisan letter to the U.S. Department of Education requesting the Department communicate with states and school districts regarding dyslexia resources that are currently available. The letter states: “On behalf of children with dyslexia and other learning disabilities in our districts, we request that the U.S. Department of Education Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) issue guidance to states and school districts regarding the use of the term ‘dyslexia.’… Despite the prevalence of dyslexia among students, parents nationwide have discovered that some states and school districts will not include – the word “dyslexia” in a students’ Individualized Educational Program (IEP). In many cases, parents have been told that their state does not “recognize” dyslexia; and instead only uses the term ‘specific learning disability.’ “Families in our Congressional districts rely on access to a high quality education for their children with dyslexia. We look forward to your ensuring that the millions of students with dyslexia receive the evidence-based instruction and interventions needed to succeed in school and life.” Full text of the letter can be found here. In addition to today’s letter, Reps. Smith and Brownley also recently introduced H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act or READ Act, a bipartisan bill to support dyslexia research.
07.30.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) this week voted for several bills to improve care for veterans and hold the Department of Veterans Affairs accountable. Rep. Lamar Smith recently joined Honor Flight San Antonio de Valero at a welcome home ceremony for World War II, Korean, and Vietnam veterans. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I’ve had many opportunities to personally thank Texas veterans for their service and sacrifice on behalf of our nation. But the best way we can thank them is by ensuring they receive the care and services they were promised. “One year after scandals at the VA first came to light, it is clear that the VA is still lagging when it comes to providing timely high-quality care to our nation’s veterans. In the House of Representatives we are working to improve the VA and the care our veterans receive. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act that was enacted last year is a good start. “This week, we took further actions to improve veteran care and hold the VA accountable for its failed policies. From providing cost-of-living increases and improving health care choices to encouraging employers to hire veterans and making it easier to fire poor performing VA employees, these bills are part of our continued commitment to our nation’s heroes.” Among the bills passed this week are: The VA Accountability Act of 2015 (Rep. Smith is a cosponsor) Authorizes the VA to fire or demote employees for poor performance (Only 3 VA employees have been fired as a result of scandals that surfaced in 2014) Protects whistleblowers from retribution The Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act Authorizes the VA to increase veterans compensation on Dec. 1 2015 in accordance with the cost-of-living adjustment rate of 1.7 percent. The Veterans Entrepreneur Act of 2015 Raises the most common Small Business Administration loan program’s (7a) lending authority from $18.75 billion to $23.5 billion through fiscal 2015. This will allow lenders to continue giving loans to veteran-owned small businesses. The Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act: Requires the VA to develop a plan to consolidate all of its non-department provided care programs into a single “Veterans Choice Program.” Allows greater eligibility for the existing Choice Program. Extends moratorium of VA’s expansion of internal dialysis capacity. Includes language from the Hire More Heroes Act, which previously passed the House with Rep. Smith’s support and makes it easier for employers to hire veterans by removing ObamaCare employee restraints
07.29.2015	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced the Scientific Research in the National Interest Act, bipartisan legislation to ensure that the National Science Foundation (NSF) is accountable to the taxpayers about how their hard-earned dollars are spent. The bill requires that each NSF public announcement of a grant award be accompanied by a non-technical explanation of the project’s scientific merits and how it serves the national interest. This written justification is intended to affirm NSF’s determination that a project is worthy of taxpayer support, based on scientific merit and serves the national interest. Chairman Smith: “We must set funding priorities that ensure America remains first in the global marketplace of basic research and technological innovation, while preventing misuse of Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars. Unfortunately, in the past NSF has funded too many questionable research grants - money that should have gone to projects in the national interest. For example, how does the federal government justify spending $220,000 to study animal photos in National Geographic? Or $50,000 to study lawsuits in Peru from 1600 - 1700? Federal research agencies have an obligation to explain to American taxpayers why their money is being used on such research instead of on more worthy projects. “Investments in basic research can lead to discoveries that change our world, expand our horizons and save lives. But we cannot afford to waste taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. For instance, the almost million dollars spent on a climate change musical could have funded research to meet real national priorities such as predicting severe weather events, discovering new sources of energy, and improving cybersecurity. All government employees and their agency heads need to remember they are accountable to the American taxpayer who pays their salaries and funds their projects. It is not the government's money; it's the people's money. The Scientific Research in the National Interest Act is a step toward more accountability.” NSF has recently recognized the need for increased transparency and accountability. NSF is now implementing a policy of clear, non-technical explanations of research projects. NSF staff and outside researchers will compose project abstracts that explain how each project meets intellectual merit criteria, is consistent with NSF’s mission, and supports the national interest. This legislation makes this commitment permanent. At a Science Committee hearing held earlier this year, NSF Director France Córdova agreed with a legislative effort to uphold a national interest standard for taxpayer-funded research grants. The Scientific Research in the National Interest Act is virtually identical to a provision that passed the House this spring as part of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015. The bill states that the NSF written justification is to be made after a proposal has completed NSF’s reviews for merit and broad impacts. The bill clearly states, “Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering the Foundation’s intellectual merit or broader impacts criteria for evaluating grant applications.” The following bipartisan members of the Science Committee are original cosponsors: Reps. Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.); Frank Lucas (R-Okla.); Alan Grayson (D-Fla.); Barbara Comstock (R-Va.); John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) Randy Weber (R-Texas); Stephen Knight (R-Calif.); Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla); Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.); Brian Babin (R-Texas); Mo Brooks (R-Ala.); Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.); Bill Johnson (R-Utah); Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.); Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas); Bill Posey (R-Fla.); Gary Palmer (R-Ala.); and Ralph Abraham (R-La.).
07.29.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) this week joined House Republicans in voting to rein in out-of-control federal regulations that burden small businesses and job creators. The House of Representatives passed the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 427) for the third straight congressional session. Congressman Smith: “The American people want job creation, not more government regulations. Unfortunately, the Obama administration has used executive branch agencies to drive its expensive, burdensome, out-of-control agenda. In 2014 alone, these regulations totaled more than $1.8 trillion. It is time to hand the American people the reins and put a stop to these costly regulatory burdens that stifle economic growth and job creation. “The REINS Act will give the people’s representatives in Congress the ability to vote on regulations with costly impacts of $100 million or more before the administration can impose them on the American people. I will continue to support legislation like this that protects Americans and encourages economic growth and job creation.” Key provisions of the REINS Act include the following: · Requires agencies to submit major regulations with economic impact of $100 million or more to Congress for approval. · Guarantees no major regulation becomes effective until Congress approves it. · Guarantees fast up or down votes on major rules—Congress must act within 70 legislative days.
07.28.2015	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) this week joined Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and 132 other House Republicans in calling for an immediate DOJ investigation of Planned Parenthood practices revealed in a series of disturbing videos. The letter addressed to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch reads: “The harvesting of human fetal body parts for sale is an activity which shocks the conscience. Moreover, the tragic ethical considerations, potential for criminal violations, and involvement of taxpayer subsidies raise issues of great public importance. As a result, we request the Department of Justice to conduct an immediate investigation into the practices of PPFA regarding the sale of fetal body parts.” Videos of Planned Parenthood executives that surfaced earlier this month raised questions of whether the tax-exempt group has been engaging in illegal activity: trafficking fetal body parts, and performing abortion procedures similar to outlawed partial-birth abortions in order to harvest organs. Smith recently condemned the “gruesome practices” and has supported House efforts to investigate the organization. A long-time opponent of federal funding being used for abortions, Smith recently supported two bills introduced by Representative Diane Black (R-Tenn.). H.R. 217, the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act would prohibit federal family planning assistance from going to any entity that performs abortions. H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act would immediately halt all federal funding for Planned Parenthood while Congress carries out its investigation. Smith has received recognition from the National Right to Life for his 100 percent pro-life voting record and recent support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban all abortions after 20 weeks.
07.23.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today participated in the House Judiciary Committee’s Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee hearing titled “Sanctuary Cities: A Threat to Public Safety.” The hearing examined dangerous policies adopted by some state and local governments that refuse to honor the federal government’s authority to enforce immigration laws and the Obama Administration’s complicity in this problem. Families of victims like Kate Steinle, who was murdered by a criminal alien who had been released by San Francisco officials, were present at the hearing, where Steinle’s father testified. Click here or on the photo above for video of Rep. Smith’s statement Congressman Smith: “In the case of the sanctuary cities; in just eight months last year they released over nine thousand individuals, who have either been arrested or convicted of serious crimes. Two thirds of those nine thousand individuals had either committed or been arrested for serious crimes. In just the few months since they were released, one quarter have committed other crimes. How many others are going to commit more crimes in the coming months, if one quarter have already committed other crimes? “This administration last year released thirty thousand criminal aliens. Two thousand under the constitution they had to release; but twenty eight thousand were released voluntarily by this administration. They committed the worst crimes imaginable, thousands of crimes. So if anything, you’ve got an administration setting the example for sanctuary cities rather than preventing sanctuary cities from trying to enforcing immigration laws. Sanctuary cities have increased exponentially for one good reason, and that is that the administration has done nothing to discourage municipalities from becoming sanctuary areas. … “Mr. Chairman I simply do not understand how anyone could oppose enforcing current immigration laws. These unnecessary victims are not Republicans or Democrats. They’re innocent Americans, and immigration laws should be enforced by everyone in America.” On Thursday, the House also is expected to consider legislation authored by Rep. Duncan Hunter, the Enforce the Laws for Sanctuary Cities Act. The bill would build upon a law previously authored by Rep. Smith, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, to strengthen enforcement of that law and withhold certain criminal justice funds from states or local governments whose policies prohibit federal officials from enforcing immigration laws. Many sanctuary cities already violate Rep. Smith’s law, which made it illegal for these sanctuary jurisdictions to withhold information about immigration status that might lead to deportations. At a DHS oversight hearing last week Secretary Jeh Johnson failed to answer questions from Rep. Smith regarding whether sanctuary cities violate federal law, and continued to argue that ICE detainers should not be made mandatory. Specifically, sanctuary jurisdictions refuse to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers or notification requests, which are the tools that federal immigration enforcement agents use to pick up criminal aliens in local jails. Incredibly, policies implemented by Obama Administration officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authorize sanctuary city policies. Under the administration’s “Priority Enforcement Program,” the administration ratifies sanctuary jurisdictions by allowing states and localities to ignore detainer requests. Witnesses for the hearing were: Mr. Jim Steinle, Father of Kathryn Steinle, Pleasanton, California Sherriff Scott Jones, Sacramento County, California Ms. Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies, Center for Immigration Studies Mr. Richard Biehl, Chief of Police, Dayton Police Department, Dayton, Ohio Video feed from today’s hearing can be accessed at https://www.c-span.org/ and https://judiciary.house.gov/.
07.23.2015	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in favor of H.R. 3009, Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act. The bill strengthens enforcement of current federal law which Rep. Smith authored, known as The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which made it illegal for jurisdictions to withhold information on immigration status that would lead to deportation. H.R. 3009 would restrict certain criminal justice funds from areas that withhold this information. Smith also participated in a House Judiciary hearing today which reviewed the dangers of sanctuary cities. Click here for video of Rep. Smith’s statement Congressman Smith advocated for the bill’s passage on the House floor: The bill is appropriately named, since sanctuary cities violate current laws that require these jurisdictions to share information with federal authorities about illegal immigrants who have been arrested. H.R. 3009 helps enforce an immigration bill I introduced several years ago that became law. This legislation withholds certain federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions that hide the immigration status of illegal immigrants charged with crimes. These reforms serve as a first step in keeping dangerous criminal immigrants off of our streets and out of our neighborhoods. Sanctuary cities have increased under this administration, which has done nothing to discourage them. During only an eight month period last year, sanctuary cities released almost nine thousand illegal immigrants charged with or convicted of serious crimes. One quarter have already been arrest again for committing more crimes, like murder and sexual assault, when does it end? I don’t understand how anyone could oppose enforcing immigration laws. These victims are not Republicans or Democrats. They are innocent Americans. Many of the crimes committed by illegal immigrants could have been prevented if the Obama Administration had enforced immigration laws. Instead, it has chosen to ignore them and innocent Americans continue to pay a steep price. I thank the gentleman from California, Mr. Hunter, for authoring this legislation. And I urge its approval. ### Congressman Smith represents the 21st District of Texas. He serves as chairman of the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee, and is a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and the House Judiciary Committee, on which he also served as chairman. He is also founder and chairman of the House Border Security Caucus and has previously been named the most effective lawmaker in Congress.
07.15.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement on a video released this week featuring a Planned Parenthood executive discussing in detail gruesome abortion practices. Congressman Smith: “The remarks of a Planned Parenthood executive that recently surfaced are nothing short of gruesome. In addition to the fact that these practices are morally repulsive, they also happen to be illegal. That is why the House today announced it will investigate these allegations. I believe that life is precious, and no life is more vulnerable than that of an unborn child.”
07.14.2015	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) at a hearing today continued to advocate for improved weather forecasting technology. Click here or on the photo above for video of Smith’s statement. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “The enhanced prediction of severe weather events is of great importance in protecting the public from injury and loss of property. My home state of Texas has seen record breaking flooding that caused widespread damage and loss of many lives in my district. “This past May, the House of Representatives passed a bill that I co-sponsored, H.R. 1561, The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015. This bill greatly improves our severe weather forecasting capabilities. In this year’s Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill, the House also approved my amendment to fully fund these crucial weather-related research activities at NOAA. “This is something that Texans, and people in any community recently affected by severe weather, can appreciate. It is time for us to bring our weather forecasting systems into the 21st century.” An understanding of NOAA’s data policies is crucial as the agency evolves to take advantage of more data sources and methods of collection. NOAA has expressed interest in purchasing space-based weather data from the private sector. This led to a pilot project within NOAA to competitively select at least one provider of space-based data to test it against NOAA’s proprietary data. This pilot program was included in H.R. 1561, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015, which unanimously passed the House of Representatives in May. NOAA relies upon different technologies, observing systems, and partnerships for data that is constantly available for use in formulating forecasts and predicting weather events to protect lives and property. For more information on today’s hearing, including witness testimony and the hearing webcast, visit the Committee’s website.
07.14.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement after the White House today announced a nuclear deal with Iran. Congressman Smith: “A nuclear Iran is an unacceptable risk to American security and world peace. Earlier this spring I voted to ensure Congress and the American people have the final say on any deal President Obama makes with Iran. This deal emboldens our enemies at the expense of our friends and our national security. It lifts the sanctions on Iran and lacks adequate enforcement measures. I will not support any deal that puts sanction relief for Iran above the safety and security of Americans and our allies." Under legislation passed in May, Congress will have 60 days for public debate and hearings to review the deal.
07.13.2015	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act (READ Act) (H.R. 3033), a bipartisan bill to support dyslexia research. Dyslexia is an unexpected difficulty in reading in an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader. It is estimated that 8.5 million U.S. school children, or one out of six, may have dyslexia. Chairman Smith: “If you can’t read, you can’t achieve. Millions of children have undiagnosed dyslexia, and millions more do not receive effective educational assistance at their schools. Dyslexia has no correlation to intelligence. By investing in early detection, children with dyslexia can learn strategies to help them read more effectively. The READ Act addresses these problems by prioritizing investments in critical dyslexia research. Understanding dyslexia is the first step to ensuring our children have access to the tools they need to read and achieve.” The READ Act requires the president’s annual budget request to Congress to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation (NSF). It also requires the NSF to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research, which would focus on best practices in the following areas: Early identification of children and students with dyslexia Professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators Curricula development and evidence-based educational tools for children with dyslexia The READ Act does not increase federal spending. It authorizes multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia research projects using funds appropriated for the NSF Research and Related Activities account and the Education and Human Resources Directorate. The READ Act was introduced by Chairman Smith along with Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.) who are the co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus. The Caucus is comprised of nearly 80 Members of Congress and is dedicated to increasing public awareness about dyslexia and ensuring all students have equal educational opportunities. Additional original co-sponsors include Science, Space, and Technology Committee Members Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) and Oversight Subcommittee Ranking Member Don Beyer (D-Va.).
07.10.2015	Today, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing to receive testimony from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy on the agency’s overreaching regulatory agenda. Click here or on the photo above for video of the full exchange. Chairman Smith: “Over the last year, the Environmental Protection Agency has released some of the most expensive and expansive regulations in its history. A glaring example is the president’s Power Plan. This plan is nothing more than a ‘Power Grab’ to give the government more control over Americans’ daily lives. Even EPA data shows that this regulation would reduce sea level rise by only 1/100th of an inch, the thickness of three sheets of paper. This rule represents massive costs without significant benefits. In other words, it’s all pain and no gain.” Chairman Smith questioned Administrator McCarthy on how the agency can justify its Clean Power Plan proposal, which is estimated to offset only 0.01 degrees Celsius. Administrator McCarthy did not dispute that estimate, and indicated the regulation is intended to urge other nations to act on their own emissions. When asked if she considers 0.01 degrees to be a significant contribution to halting climate change, Administrator McCarthy said, “No, the value of this rule is not measured in that way. It is measured in showing strong domestic action which can actually trigger global action to address what is necessary action.” Members also asked Administrator McCarthy about the agency’s proposed ozone standards that are estimated to cost taxpayers millions of dollars and could be unachievable in certain areas, due to naturally occurring ozone levels. A report released today by the Center for Regulatory Solutions shows that the ozone standards would put many jobs at risk, particularly in the greater Chicago area. Members questioned the need for such a rule when EPA’s own figures show that since 1980, ozone levels have decreased by 33 percent and continue to improve. Several Members also asked about the EPA’s lack of independence. The Science Committee recently requested information and documents related to the EPA’s development of the proposed Waters of the U.S. rule and the agency’s inappropriate lobbying of outside organizations to generate grassroots support. Members today questioned inappropriate relationships between the EPA and outside environmental groups. The Committee obtained a number of emails between environmental groups such as the National Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters and Michael Goo, former Associate Administrator of the EPA Office of Policy. The emails include evidence that Mr. Goo shared draft documents with outside groups and urged them to write reports in support of EPA actions. Members today asked Administrator McCarthy if this is a typical way the agency conducts business. For additional information on today’s hearing, including witness testimony and the archived webcast, visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
07.08.2015	By voice vote, the House of Representatives adopted a second amendment offered by Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to H.R. 2822, the Department of Interior appropriations bill. The amendment would prohibit the EPA from basing regulations on research data that is not publicly available. A previously adopted Smith amendment cut EPA budgets, citing the agency’s obstruction to congressional requests. The Interior appropriations bill, including both amendments, is expected to pass in the House later this week. Chairman Smith: “This amendment simply requires the Environmental Protection Agency to base its regulations on publicly-available data that can be verified. Why would the Administration want to hide this information from the American people? Many Americans are unaware that some of the EPA’s most expensive and burdensome regulations, such as its proposed climate and ozone rules, are based on underlying data that not even the EPA has seen. This amendment ensures that the decisions that affect every American are based on independently-verified, unbiased scientific research, instead of on secret data that is hidden from the American people. That’s the scientific method. “This amendment also assures that the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) is able to provide meaningful, balanced, and independent assessments of the science behind the EPA regulations. The EPA frequently undermines the SAB’s independence and prevents it from being able to provide advice to Congress. As a result, the valuable advice these experts can provide is often ignored or silenced. The EPA has a responsibility to be open and transparent with the people it serves and whose money its uses.” Smith’s amendment follows a spate of recent criticism over EPA transparency. For example, the Center for Effective Government gave the EPA a grade of “D” in its most recent report for poor performance in providing access to information. The House Science Committee will hold a hearing tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. to receive testimony from EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the EPA’s regulatory agenda.
07.07.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) joined fellow San Antonio congressional representatives in praising a recent decision of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to name the five San Antonio Missions, including the Alamo, as a World Heritage Site. The iconic Spanish missions were built by Franciscan missionaries in the 18th century when San Antonio was part of colonial New Spain and are an example of the interweaving of Spanish and Coahuiltecan cultures. The five missions consist of Mission Concepción, Mission San José, Mission San Juan, Mission Espada and Mission San Antonio de Valero (The Alamo) and embody nearly 300 years of history and culture. They continued to play an important role in early Mexican history and during the struggle for Texas independence. Last December, the San Antonio delegation also shepherded passage of legislation to expand the boundaries of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. “Congratulations to the city of San Antonio, Bexar County, and all who have been involved in obtaining this high honor. The San Antonio missions embody our rich heritage,” said Congressman Lamar Smith. “These Missions are more than Texas landmarks; they are international treasures that we will continue working to preserve and protect for generations to come.” "The designation of the historic San Antonio missions as a UNESCO World Heritage Site is something all of Texas and the United States should celebrate proudly,” said Congressman Henry Cuellar. “These missions are a testament to the long and rich history of Texas and its people. They serve as a looking glass into what life was like in colonial New Spain and independent Texas. This designation is also one of personal pride for San Antonians, many of whom are the descendants of the original Coahuiltecan peoples and Spanish immigrants who lived in and around the area.” “I am proud and grateful that UNESCO designated the San Antonio Missions a World Heritage Site,” said Congressman Joaquin Castro. “Today is particularly special for the many San Antonians who have worked for years to make this prestigious honor a reality. Not only does the World Heritage Site designation raise San Antonio’s international profile, it stands to add over a thousand jobs and more than $100 million to our city’s economy. This recognition is just one more reason why folks from around the world should be sure to visit San Antonio and enjoy all our culturally rich city has to offer.” “This success results from years of effort by so many,” said Congressman Lloyd Doggett. “Now more people from around the world will come to appreciate our treasure that represents the culture and diversity of San Antonio. What we have long known is officially recognized—our Missions are a part of what is formally called the “patrimony of humankind.” "Texans have long been proud of the rich heritage and culture represented by these missions and we are grateful to see them receiving the international recognition that they are due,” said Congressman Will Hurd. "This decision shines a light on a history and a community which are more than worthy. I look forward to seeing the great benefits that San Antonio will receive as visitors from around the world travel to see these beautiful missions for themselves. My thanks goes to the many individuals and organizations who have worked so hard to make this a reality."
07.07.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today spoke on the House floor condemning the recent killing of a young woman in San Francisco by a convicted criminal illegal immigrant who had been previously deported five times. San Francisco is one of more than 200 state and local jurisdictions that operates under sanctuary policies that call for not honoring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention requests. Click here to watch Rep. Smith’s remarks on the House floor. Full text of Rep. Smith’s remarks can be found below: Dangerous policies have deadly consequences. We were reminded of this last week when a young woman in San Francisco, Katie Steinle, was tragically murdered by an illegal immigrant who should have been deported long ago. Unknown to many Americans, cities across the nation like San Francisco have declared that they will be a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. They refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, in violation of federal law. And victims like Kate Steinle pay the ultimate price. This administration, regrettably, has condoned sanctuary cities and has done nothing to make them abide by federal immigration laws. In this case, the killer had been ordered deported five times and charged with seven previous felonies, but had been released instead. If this administration and local officials in sanctuary cities care about the safety of the American people, they should work to secure our borders and uphold, not undermine, our immigration laws. In April, Smith questioned ICE Director Sarah Saldana over the agency’s release of tens of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants:“Why did the administration intentionally endanger the lives of innocent Americans by releasing thousands of criminal aliens into our neighborhoods? … You yourself had said one reason you’re not enforcing laws is because local communities fail to comply with it. Why aren’t you trying to enforce it? In what ways have you tried to force local communities to follow federal law?”
07.07.2015	In response to continued obstruction of congressional requests, Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) along with Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) today offered an amendment to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. The amendment was offered to a Department of Interior appropriations bill (H.R. 2822) and would cut existing budgets in half for both EPA’s Office of the Administrator and the Office of Legislative Affairs. The amendment was agreed to by voice vote. Click HERE to view a video of Smith's floor remarks. Chairman Smith: “The amendment addresses the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) continuing pattern of obstruction and delay in response to Congressional oversight. Since January 2014, the EPA has proposed or finalized new, far-reaching rules that impact almost every aspect of the American economy. These rules involve major expansions of federal authority, massive costs to the economy, and are based on secret science that the EPA keeps hidden from external review or scrutiny. Congress has a Constitutional responsibility to perform rigorous oversight of the Executive Branch. However, as Chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, nearly every request for information to EPA is greeted with repeated delays, partial responses, or outright refusals to cooperate. EPA must refocus its efforts on transparency and cooperation with Congress and the American people. At that point, we could consider restoring their funding.” The Science Committee will hold a hearing this Thursday at 10:00 A.M. to receive testimony from EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the EPA’s regulatory agenda.
06.30.2015	San Antonio, Texas - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in observance of our nation’s 239th Independence Day: “This Independence Day, I want to take time to reflect on the freedoms that make our nation great. “Just a few short weeks ago I had the honor of recognizing a local and national treasure, Lieutenant Colonel Richard “Dick” Cole. More than 250 members of the local community joined me in honoring LTC Cole in his hometown of Comfort. LTC Cole is one of just two surviving members of the famous Doolittle Tokyo Raiders who volunteered for a dangerous retaliation mission after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. He not only flew in the mission, but also flew in the first plane as Jimmy Doolittle’s co-pilot. I am encouraged every time I think of the honor and the valor these brave individuals displayed on behalf of our country. It is the same bravery our soldiers show today in the fight against terrorism. And it is the same bravery the original colonists showed when they risked everything to fight for American independence. This week we honor the many who have served and the many who have given the ultimate sacrifice so that we might continue to live in freedom. “I am also reminded of the unique makeup of our country - 50 states united and bound by a Constitution intended to protect the liberties and rights of our citizens. The government does not give these liberties to the people. As stated in the Declaration of Independence, people are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.” This noble document also reminds us that the government derives its power “from the consent of the governed.” And for many issues, states like Texas have the right to make laws and govern within their borders in ways that look different from other states. That is the beauty of our system of government. “Thomas Jefferson reminded us that “the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.” Our forefathers would not be surprised that some in the federal government seek to expand power and control over Americans’ daily lives. They foresaw this problem. They warned that American freedoms and liberties would be in jeopardy the moment we, as Americans, stop paying attention and stop demanding accountability from our government. “Eternal vigilance from engaged citizens is necessary for the health and well-being of our nation. It is as much a part of our American heritage as baseball and apple pie. “I wish each of you a safe and happy Fourth of July. And may God continue to bless America.” At a ceremony in Comfort earlier this month, Congressman Lamar Smith presents Doolittle Raider and WWII veteran Lieutenant Colonel Richard “Dick” Cole with a replica of the Congressional Gold Medal and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
06.29.2015	– Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that EPA must consider cost before deciding whether the Mercury Air Toxics regulation is appropriate and necessary to regulate under the Clean Air Act. Chairman Smith: “Today’s Supreme Court ruling is an important step towards reining in the actions of the EPA. The EPA consistently ignores the tremendous costs of rules and relies on hidden scientific data to justify its overreaching regulations. Considering the costs of a regulation is simply common sense. I welcome today’s Supreme Court ruling and urge the EPA to more accurately consider the excessive costs that all of its rules will impose on the American people.”
06.26.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Congressman Smith: “I am disappointed the Supreme Court chose not to respect the will of millions of Americans in states like Texas. Throughout history, marriage between a man and a woman has been the cement that has held civilizations together. Many Texans’ views are shaped by their faith and deeply-held religious beliefs. We must ensure religious freedoms, as guaranteed in the Constitution, continue to be protected.”
06.25.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to a Supreme Court ruling that upheld changes the Internal Revenue Service made to the law when implementing subsidies. Click here or on the photo above to watch Rep. Smith’s response to the Supreme Court ruling. Congressman Smith: “Ever since this controversial law was passed 5 years ago, Democrats and this administration have worked overtime to save ObamaCare. But my goal is to protect the American people, not this failed law. “There are many who will be quick to declare winners and losers in this case. The American people are the ones who lost on the day ObamaCare was signed into law. Millions who were promised they could keep their doctors and their health plans lost them. Still millions more have seen their insurance costs rise. Two years ago the Supreme Court confirmed that ObamaCare’s individual mandate could only be upheld as a tax. And one of the law’s chief architects has bragged that the law was only passed thanks to the ‘stupidity of the American voter.’ “ObamaCare’s policies are bad enough but its implementation continues to create problems for the American people. To this day, the $2 billion healthcare.gov website has glitches. Yet this administration has forced Americans to put their private information on this failed website that the president himself has described as a ‘well-documented disaster.’ Over the past 2 years, as chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I have raised concerns about the security of HealthCare.gov. And other hacks to government agencies in recent weeks have exposed the personal information of millions of federal employees. “Some have criticized House Republicans for our persistence in wanting to fully repeal this extremely damaging law. I have voted more than 50 times to repeal, replace, dismantle or defund the law in some form or fashion. But today’s ruling only motivates us to keep working to end the nightmare that is ObamaCare. “I believe the only mandate that Americans are interested in is the one they gave Republicans last November - to put an end to this law once and for all. That is why I continue to call on the Senate to take up the House-passed bills to fully repeal this law and work with us to replace it with common-sense solutions.” According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, under ObamaCare the cost of insurance in Texas has increased by 79 percent for the average 27-year-old man, and 54 percent for the average 40-year-old man. The average 27-year-old woman has seen increases of 29 percent and the average 64-year-old woman’s insurance has increased by 18 percent.
06.24.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted to repeal Medicare’s Independent Payment Advisory Board, one of the most controversial programs authorized under the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare. Smith is a cosponsor of the bill, H.R. 1190, Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act. Congressman Smith: “I continue working to fully repeal ObamaCare because ObamaCare continues to be a costly burden on Texans and the American people. “Today I voted to repeal Medicare’s Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). The IPAB places an unelected board of federal employees in between patients and their doctors. This panel was specifically authorized under ObamaCare to prioritize arbitrary cost-cutting measures over the care of seniors. Seniors deserve better. “As we work to relieve Americans from the burden of ObamaCare, I urge the Senate to take up the House-passed bills to fully repeal this failed law.” Smith has voted more than 50 times to repeal or change the flawed health care law, including twice in the 114th Congress which began in January.
06.24.2015	Washington, D.C. – House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today praised H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015 in a hearing on the economic impacts of the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to regulate power plants. The bill, which passed in the House, would give states flexibility and even exemptions from federal regulations if a state’s governor determines that such plans would increase electricity prices. The purpose of today’s hearing was to examine a U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) report Chairman Smith requested in August 2014 and that was released last month. Click here to watch Chairman Smith’s remarks on EPA’s power regulations. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “The president’s Power Plan is nothing more than a ‘Power Grab’ to give the government more control over Americans’ daily lives. These regulations stifle economic growth, destroy American jobs, and increase energy prices. That means everything will cost more – from electricity to gasoline to food. The EPA should not saddle the American people with extensive and burdensome regulations, especially if the regulations have little environmental impact. This bill allows states to decide whether the so-called Clean Power Plan is in the best interest of the state, given the tremendous costs it will impose on American families.” The EPA’s plan would require states to meet requirements for carbon emissions from electricity generating units. The EIA found that the rule would have a significant impact in retiring a large number of coal-fired power plants and that electricity prices would significantly increase by up to 7% annually, with certain regions seeing increases even greater than the average projections.
06.19.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today hosted a ceremony in Comfort, Texas, to honor local World War II veteran and Doolittle Tokyo Raider Lieutenant Colonel Richard “Dick” E. Cole. Cole is one of just two surviving members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. More than 200 local residents attended Friday morning’s ceremony to honor Lt. Col. Cole. Congressman Smith presents Lt. Col. Cole with a flag flown over the Capitol in his honor and a bronze medal replica of the Congressional Gold medal. Congressman Smith: “Thanks to everyone for joining us to honor Comfort resident Lieutenant Colonel Richard “Dick” Cole and the proud legacy of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. It is understandable that only a city park would be big enough to hold everyone who would want to come to a special occasion like this. “The Doolittle Tokyo Raiders exemplify courage and patriotism. Their actions in 1942 are read about in books, seen in documentaries, and discussed in classrooms. “The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 destroyed many of our Navy ships and injured and killed many Americans. But it did not break our determination to defend ourselves and protect our freedoms. About four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, an all-volunteer effort that involved 80 men and sixteen B-25 bombers struck military targets in Japan. Col. Cole was Doolittle’s co-pilot in aircraft #1, helping to ensure the mission was a success. “As one of just two surviving Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, Lieutenant Colonel Cole is both a local and a national treasure. The House of Representatives passed a resolution last year to honor the outstanding heroism, valor, skill, and service of the World War II members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. Earlier this year, the House presented them with the Congressional Gold Medal. Unfortunately, Col. Cole was not able to make it to D.C. for the presentation. So we decided to bring the ceremony to him. “The debt we owe our military men and women can never fully be repaid. And for that we are most grateful. Thanks go to Col. Cole for his service and congratulations to him on this well-deserved award.” Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cole graduated from Steele High School in Dayton, Ohio and completed two years college at Ohio University before enlisting in the Army Air Corps in November 1940. He completed pilot training and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in July 1941. He participated in the Doolittle Raid as Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle’s co-pilot in aircraft #1. He remained in China-Burma-India after the Tokyo Raid until June 1943, and served again in the China-Burma-India Theater from October, 1943 until June, 1944. Cole now resides with family in Comfort, Texas. He is one of just two living Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. The crowd gathered at the Comfort Park Pavilion.
06.18.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in favor of H.R. 160, The Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015, which repeals ObamaCare’s controversial medical device tax. Smith has voted more than 50 times to repeal or change the flawed health care law, including twice in the 114th Congress which began in January. The bill passed with bipartisan support by a vote of 280-140. Congressman Smith: “I continue working to fully repeal ObamaCare because ObamaCare continues to be a costly burden on Texans and the American people. “Today I voted to repeal the medical device tax. The medical device tax has grown increasingly unpopular as people all across the country have realized it threatens innovation, tens of thousands of small business jobs, and could cause prices to increase on everything from pacemakers to dentures. “As we work to relieve Americans from the burdens of ObamaCare, I continue to urge the Senate to take up the House-passed bills to fully repeal this failed law.”
06.18.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after voting once more to give Congress and the American people control over the president’s existing power to negotiate trade agreements. Congressman Smith: “I support Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) because it ensures Congress has the final say when there is a vote on any trade agreement, from any president. That includes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which has not been finalized and has not yet been considered by Congress. “TPA ensures trade agreements are considered in the most transparent manner possible by requiring the full text of trade agreements like TPP to be made public. TPA will give Congress and the public 60 days to review any trade agreement and then Congress can either approve or reject it. I have already reviewed a draft of the current Trans-Pacific Partnership, and I encourage my constituents to read it once the draft language is finalized. The Obama administration has the burden of proving that the TPP will benefit both the U.S. and Texas. If it cannot do that, I will not support TPP. I have also supported provisions in TPA to ensure that the president cannot use trade agreements to change the immigration laws of the U.S. or expand access to visas without Congressional approval. “Texas leads all other states in the export of goods and services. Free trade supports three million jobs in Texas and 40,000 local businesses. More than one in four jobs recently created in Texas have come from exports. In the 21st Congressional District alone, local businesses exported more than $19 billion of goods and services in 2013. “I support free market and free trade policies that encourage job creation and economic growth, and I will continue to advocate for Congress’s oversight role in trade agreements. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) will put a much-needed check on the Obama administration’s existing ability to enact any such agreements.” In May, the Senate passed Trade Promotion Authority with the support of both Texas Republican Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Trade Promotion Authority allows negotiations to move forward on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a possible free trade agreement between the U.S. and 11 other countries, including Japan and Australia. But the Trans-Pacific Partnership itself would still face another vote in Congress before the U.S. could enter into the agreement.
06.17.2015	The House Judiciary Committee today approved the Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2015 (H.R. 1643), by a voice vote. The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2015 is a widely supported measure that prevents multiple taxation of digital goods by setting sourcing rules for the purchase of digital goods and services to prevent multiple taxation. As such, it helps implement the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act’s ban on multiple taxes of Internet commerce. The legislation also bars discriminatory taxation of digital goods and services. Congressman Smith: “In our modern economy, more and more consumers are buying digital goods and services rather than tangible items. Consumers shouldn’t be punished with higher taxes simply because they purchase an e-book instead of a paperback, or download an MP3 instead of purchasing a CD. The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2015 protects consumers from unfair and duplicative taxes on digital goods. This is the kind of 21st century legislation we need if we want to promote tax fairness and ensure that consumers are not discouraged from purchasing digital goods.” Chairman Goodlatte applauded the Committee’s passage of the legislation, and the leadership taken by former House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas). Chairman Goodlatte: “I applaud the Committee’s approval of this very important legislation to address the issue of taxing digital goods and services that are now a major part of our nation’s marketplace. A bipartisan group of Judiciary Committee members have come together to level the playing field for the taxpayers. In today's growing digital economy it is critical that there be clear rules of the road to protect consumers from multiple taxation. The passage of this bill ensures this important sector of our economy can continue to grow unimpeded by the spectre of unfair multiple-taxation.” Smith introduced the bipartisan legislation earlier this year alongside Congressman Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.). Representatives Steve Chabot (OH-01), Trent Franks (AZ-09), and Blake Farenthold (TX-27) also cosponsored this legislation. Companion legislation was introduced in the Senate by Senators John Thune (R-S.D.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).
06.17.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) recently met with the 2015 military academy appointees from the 21st Congressional District. The students, who were initially selected by a third-party panel of judges, were accepted into the academies after being nominated by Congressman Smith. The students will attend three of the U.S. Service Academies beginning this summer. Congressman Smith: “Each year I have the pleasure of nominating outstanding young men and women from the 21st District to the United States' military service academies. These candidates have shown they possess the character, scholarship, leadership, physical fitness, and motivation necessary to be successful. I congratulate this year’s nominees. As they take their places at their respective academies, these nominees join a proud tradition of service to our country.” Congressman Smith meets with 2015 student nominees to the U.S. military academies This year’s nominees are: McKinlee Marie Boss, Smithson Valley High School, United States Military Academy William Ellis Cooper, Jack C. Hays High School, United States Air Force Academy Shelby Lee Feldman, Comfort High School, United States Air Force Academy Rollins Law Olmsted, Our Lady of the Hills Catholic High School, Greystone Preparatory School at Schreiner University, United States Military Academy Nicholas Cole Smisek, Winston Churchill High School, United States Air Force Academy Eric James Yandura, Claudia Taylor “Lady Bird” Johnson High School, United States Air Force Academy Elisa Elena Nelson, Winston Churchill High School, United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School, United States Air Force Academy Scott Allen Pofahl, Bandera High School, Greystone Preparatory School at Schreiner University, United States Military Academy Aaron Raoul Solorzano, Alamo Heights High School, United States Military Academy Travis S. Pospisil, Boerne-Samuel V.

The deadline for applying is October 24, 2015. Any student interested in applying for a nomination may download a copy of the current application on Congressman Smith’s website: www.lamarsmith.house.gov.
06.16.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today spoke in favor of H.R. 2559, which passed in the House with unanimous bipartisan support. The bill would rename part of I-10 in Kendall County in honor of PFC Milton A. Lee, who died in combat in Vietnam on April 26, 1968 at the age of 19. Lee was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House in 1970 for ‘conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.’ He is buried at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio. The bill must still be passed in the Senate before it becomes law. Click here to watch video from Chairman Smith’s remarks on the House floor Congressman Smith: “It is a privilege to recognize veteran, patriot and Medal of Honor recipient Milton A. Lee today. Earlier this year I introduced H.R. 2559 which designates a portion of I-10 in Boerne, Texas, as ‘PFC Milton A. Lee Medal of Honor Highway.’ “PFC Lee was born on February 28, 1949, in Shreveport, Louisiana. While he was not born in Texas, Lee entered the Army in San Antonio, served honorably in the Vietnam War and is laid to rest at Ft. Sam Houston, which is located in my district. “PFC Lee served as a radio telephone operator with the 3rd platoon, Company B. during an intense, surprise hostile attack by North Vietnamese Army fighters. The 3rd platoon maneuvered to a position of cover to treat their wounded and reorganize. Meanwhile, PFC Lee moved through the heavy enemy fire to give lifesaving first aid to his wounded fellow soldiers. “During the subsequent assault, PFC Lee continuously kept close radio contact with the company commander and relayed precise and understandable information to his platoon leader. While advancing toward the objective, PFC Lee observed 4 North Vietnamese soldiers with automatic weapons and a rocket launcher lying in wait for his platoon. “PFC Lee immediately and with great risk to his own personal safety, passed his radio to another soldier and charged through the barrage of fire. Without hesitation he continued his attack, and successfully overran the enemy position, killing all occupants and capturing 4 automatic weapons and a rocket launcher. PFC Lee continued his one-man assault on another enemy position through a heavy barrage of enemy automatic weapons fire. Although wounded, he continued to press the attack and crawled forward into a firing position to deliver accurate cover fire for his platoon. This enabled his platoon to maneuver and destroy the position. Not until the position was overrun did PFC Lee falter in his steady volume of fire and succumb to his wounds. “PFC Lee's heroic actions saved the lives of many in his platoon and were instrumental in the destruction of a key position of the enemy’s defense. PFC Lee's gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty epitomizes the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on himself, the 502nd Infantry, and the U.S. Army. “So today I urge my colleagues to support this bill in honor of an American hero. In giving his life for our country in such a selfless and heroic fashion, PFC Lee is deserving of our naming a portion of a federal highway in his honor.”
06.12.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after voting to give Congress and the American people control over the president’s existing power to negotiate trade agreements. Congressman Smith: “Congress and the American people should have a say when it comes to trade agreements. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) will put a much-needed check on the Obama administration’s existing ability to enact trade agreements without Congress’ approval. TPA will ensure Congress has the final say when there is a vote on any trade agreement, from any president.

06.11.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today announced a ceremony to honor local World War II veteran and Doolittle Tokyo Raider Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cole of Comfort, Texas. Cole is one of just two surviving members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders. Congressman Smith: “As one of just two surviving Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cole is both a local and a national treasure. The bravery of these men provided an American victory at a crucial time following the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. With this volunteer mission, the Doolittle Raiders left a distinct mark on our nation and the world’s history. Lieutenant Colonel Cole was unable to participate in the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony for the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders that took place in Washington, D.C. earlier this year. The ceremony on June 19th presents an opportunity for the local community to honor Lieutenant Colonel Cole and the proud legacy of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders.” Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Lieutenant Colonel James Harold “Jimmy” Doolittle was tasked by President Franklin Roosevelt with the mission to bomb Japan in retaliation and as a means to boost American morale. The successful mission known as the Doolittle Tokyo Raid took place on 18 April 1942, as an all-volunteer effort involving 80 men and sixteen B-25B bombers that struck military targets in Japan before fleeing to China and the Soviet Union. Fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned to the United States or to American forces. Lieutenant Colonel Richard E. Cole graduated from Steele High School in Dayton, Ohio and completed two years college at Ohio University before enlisting in the Army Air Corps in November 1940. He completed pilot training and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in July 1941. He participated in the Doolittle Raid as Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle’s co-pilot in aircraft #1. He remained in China-Burma-India after the Tokyo Raid until June 1943, and served again in the China-Burma-India Theater from October, 1943 until June, 1944. Cole now resides with family in Comfort, Texas. He is one of just two living Doolittle Tokyo Raiders.
06.10.2015	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a scientific finding concluding that carbon emissions from commercial airplanes contribute to pollution, a first step in the EPA’s effort to regulate airline emissions. Chairman Smith: “The sky is the limit when it comes to how much of the U.S. economy the EPA wants to control. The EPA today released a finding that emissions from commercial airplanes are harmful to human health, which opens the door for new regulations. Such regulations would increase the price of airfare for Americans and harm our domestic carriers. Over the last fifty years, the fuel efficiency of jetliners has increased by 70 percent. Incentives are already in place to make air travel more energy efficient. This proposal is the next leg of a nonstop journey by the EPA to control how Americans live, work and travel.”
06.08.2015	On Wednesday, June 3rd, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) hosted a telephone town meeting with veterans from the 21st District of Texas and House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla). During the call, Smith and Miller discussed legislation the House of Representatives has passed and answered questions from veterans. More than 1,800 veterans participated in the call. Congressman Smith: “I thank all those who joined me and Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller for a telephone town hall on Wednesday evening. These conversations are important to help me stay informed about the kind of care my constituents are receiving. “A year after scandals at the VA first came to light, it is clear that the VA is still missing the mark when it comes to providing high quality, timely care to our nation’s veterans. I will continue to hold VA facilities serving veterans in my district accountable. “In the House of Representatives we are working to improve the VA and the care our veterans receive. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act that was enacted last year is a good start. I want to ensure that veterans, from San Antonio to Austin to the Hill Country, are benefiting from the legislation we passed, and receiving the benefits they have earned. “My office is always available to assist veterans with VA benefits and services and I strongly encourage any veterans who have experienced difficulties with benefits or appointment times to contact my office. Our veterans deserve the best health care, not delayed health care.” Below are the results of the random telephone poll from Wednesday’s call with veterans in the 21st Congressional District: 90% of respondents believe that problems at the VA are a result of mismanagement 96% of respondents believe veterans should receive private care at the VA’s expense if the nearest VA facility does not provide the care they need Only 34% of veterans polled say their experience at the VA has improved since allegations of wrongdoing have surfaced Following last spring’s scandals at several VA facilities across the country, Congressman Lamar Smith met with then-Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson and demanded an investigation into Veterans Affairs facilities throughout Texas. Twenty-three members of the Texas delegation joined Smith in calling for this initiative. Last July, Congress passed legislation to improve access to care for veterans and accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs. In November, the new law officially went into effect. According to the new law, veterans should never have to wait longer than 30 days for a medical appointment, and those living more than 40 miles from a VA facility should be allowed to seek private care at the expense of the VA. Other legislation would expand long-term care choices for veterans and make it easier for the Secretary of the VA to recoup bonuses from VA employees for causes such as mismanagement and negligence. Veterans residing in the 21st Congressional District who need assistance are encouraged to contact Smith’s offices using the following numbers: San Antonio: (210) 821-5024 Austin: (512) 912-7508 Kerrville: (830) 896-0154 Congressman Smith and Vets Affairs Chair Jeff Miller give an update on recent efforts to improve care at the VA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBNZxOUPWw
06.04.2015	The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee today held a hearing to examine the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recent regulatory agenda, including the lack of scientific and technical justification for regulations and their impact on American competitiveness. Witnesses focused on three specific proposals: the Clean Power Plan, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone, and the Waters of the United States, recently rebranded the “Clean Water Rule” by EPA. Chairman Smith: “These rules will cost billions of dollars, place a heavy burden on American families and diminish the competitiveness of American industry around the world. The so-called Clean Power Plan is a power grab that will force states to reach arbitrary and often impossible targets for carbon emissions. The EPA also seeks to impose stricter ozone standards that analysis conducted by EPA shows would cost at least $15 billion annually. Once again, these costs come with few benefits. “Last week, the EPA submitted its final rule to define the ‘Waters of the United States.’ As many had predicted, EPA has claimed unprecedented jurisdiction over many different kinds of water, including those that temporarily result from a ‘drizzle’ and areas that are not always filled with water. Under this regulatory regime, Americans will be subject to required permits and the constant threat of government intervention. The onslaught of EPA regulations continues.” Witnesses today stressed that these EPA rules will have significant legal and economic implications for the American people. The final “Waters of the United States” rule released last week represents a tremendous expansion of EPA jurisdiction with regard to the Clean Water Act. EPA asserts that the Clean Power Plan will help combat climate change. However, EPA’s own data shows that this regulation would eliminate much less than one percent of global carbon emissions and would reduce sea level rise by only 1/100th of an inch, the thickness of three sheets of paper. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages 90% of Texas’ electric grid, has determined that energy costs for consumers may increase by up to 20% in 2020 under EPA’s Clean Power Plan, without accounting for the associated costs of transmission upgrades, natural gas supply infrastructure upgrades, procurement of additional ancillary services, energy efficiency investments, capital costs of new capacity, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in ERCOT. Consideration of these factors could result in even higher energy costs for consumers. The non-partisan, non-profit Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) says Texas has the one of the world’s most efficient and clean electricity markets, with current carbon emissions rates significantly below the national average. According to TPPF analysis, Texas would be unfairly burdened under The Clean Power Plan compared to other states, shouldering the burden of at least 18 percent of total national emissions reduction under the plan. According to Energy Venture’s analysis, Texas electric bills will increase by 48 percent and gas bills by 75 percent, much higher increases than the national average. A similar energy plan enacted earlier in Germany has led to retail electric rates three times the US average. EPA also seeks to impose stricter ozone standards by lowering the standard from the current 75 parts per billion (ppb) to between 65-70 ppb. But witnesses today raised concerns that EPA has failed to allow its independent science advisors to fully analyze the impacts of this rule by limiting the scope of the analysis. Witnesses said that EPA has ignored its responsibility to assist the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) in fulfilling its responsibility to advise the Administrator “of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects” which may result from lowering ozone standards. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) today released a report requested by Chairman Smith that reiterates these concerns, finding that EPA limited CASAC from conducting full reviews and providing complete scientific advice, as required by law. The following witnesses testified today: Mr. Bill Kovacs, Senior Vice President, Environment, Technology and Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Mr. Bob Kerr, President, Kerr Environmental Services Corp. Dr. Jerome A. Paulson, FAAP Chair, American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Environmental Health Executive Committee Mr. Ross Eisenberg, Vice President, Energy and Resources Policy, National Association of Manufacturers For more information on the hearing, including witness testimony and a link to archived webcast, visit the Committee website.
06.02.2015	Washington, DC—House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced an amendment to H.R. 2578, the Fiscal Year 2016 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Act that increases funding for improved weather forecasting technology by $21 million. The funding would be used to implement activities authorized in Smith’s bipartisan Science Committee legislation, H.R. 1561, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015, which passed the House of Representatives unanimously just weeks ago. The amendment was approved by voice vote. Full passage on the bill is expected later this week. Click here to watch video from Chairman Smith’s remarks on the House floor Congressman Smith: “My amendment takes direct, strong action to address America’s weather forecasting shortcomings in order to reduce the loss of life and property from severe storms. The amendment I offer on behalf of myself, Science Committee Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Jim Bridenstine directs the full $120 million authorized in House-passed H.R. 1561, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015, be provided in the NOAA Operations, Research, and Facilities appropriation account. “The recent flooding in Texas and tornadoes in Oklahoma demonstrate the immediate need to quickly implement better weather research and forecasting by fully funding H.R. 1561. The House unanimously passed that bill just two weeks ago. We also unanimously passed it over a year ago in April, 2014. Now, thanks to Chairman Culberson’s initiative and support, the CJS bill will add the needed resources to transform our antiquated 1980’s weather forecasting system into a 21st Century weather enterprise in the next few years.” H.R. 1561, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015 aims to improve protection of lives and property through a focused program of investment on near-term, affordable, and attainable advances in observational, computing, and modeling capabilities to support substantial improvement in weather forecasting and prediction of high impact weather events with an emphasis on research-to-operations technology transfer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The bill codifies and expands NOAA weather research activities, directing the agency to place priority emphasis on development of more accurate and timely warnings and forecasts of high impact weather events, including: hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, storm surges, and wildfires. It would improve understanding of how the public responds to warnings and transfer new technology to the National Weather Service, the American weather industry, and academic partners. Smith worked with Congressman John Culberson (R-Texas), chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, to amend H.R. 2578 and add funding for weather forecasting activities. The weather forecasting bill, H.R. 1561, previously received 25 letters of support from various entities representing the weather enterprise and industry. Accuweather: “This bill is unique and creative and for the first time both acknowledges and brings together the government agencies, academia, and the American Weather Industry as cooperative and constructive partners in improving the data, research, models, and most importantly the warnings of severe weather, to the American public.” Global Weather Corporation: “We applaud your forward thinking to motivate innovative approaches that improve weather data procurement. Among other things, this will enable NOAA to better consider commercial data that could be more cost sustainable and help save lives.” Science and Technology Corporation (STC): “This bipartisan bill will help improve America’s severe weather forecasting capabilities through a visionary weather research plan at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).” The Weather Coalition: “When passed, this bill will represent a major step toward improvements in our nation’s weather prediction capabilities.” More statements of support can be found here. ### Congressman Smith represents the 21st District of Texas. He serves as chairman of the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee, and is a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and the House Judiciary Committee, on which he also served as chairman. He is also founder and chairman of the House Border Security Caucus and has previously been named the most effective lawmaker in Congress.
05.28.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has invited veterans across the 21st congressional district to participate in a telephone town hall on Wednesday, June 3rd. Congressman Smith: “America’s veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms. In the wake of scandals at the VA, Congress has taken action to ensure our nation’s veterans receive the best care, not delayed care. I want to ensure that veterans, from San Antonio to Austin to the Hill Country, are seeing the intended effects of this legislation and receiving the benefits they have earned. I invite all area veterans to join me and House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller to participate in this telephone conversation.” The telephone town hall will take place on Wednesday, June 3rd at 7:00 PM CT. Those wishing to participate can sign up by visiting Congressman Smith’s website: www.lamarsmith.house.gov.
05.27.2015	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its controversial Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule, under a new name, the “Clean Water Rule.” The EPA has long claimed the rule is intended to define which bodies of water can be regulated by the Clean Water Act. But the rule is written so broadly it could allow the EPA to regulate virtually every body of water in the United States, including private and public lakes, ponds and streams. Chairman Smith: “Today, the EPA rolled out its controversial Waters of the U.S. rule along with a new PR campaign attempting to rebrand the rule’s tarnished image. But cosmetic updates cannot hide the fact that it’s still a massive power grab of private property. America’s farmers, landowners and small businesses are right to be concerned. The rule expands the EPA’s jurisdiction, giving the agency the power to restrict Americans from making decisions about their own property. In addition, the agency inappropriately lobbied external organizations to provide supportive comments. This week, I along with Chairmen Chaffetz and Conaway sent a letter to the EPA demanding information about those efforts. The EPA needs to take a step back, truly engage with stakeholders and be open and transparent about its intentions.” Smith has sent several letters to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy questioning the agency's rushed process and lack of transparency in pushing the WOTUS rule on the American people. More than 30 governors and state legislators across the country have also voiced their concerns about the threats to freedom and opportunity posed by this regulatory overreach. Earlier this month, Smith voted in favor of the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which would require the EPA to withdraw the Waters of the U.S. rule and seek out adequate stakeholder input before proposing a new rule. More than 200 local residents recently joined Chairman Smith for a regulation roundtable discussion in Kerrville focused on reining in the EPA’s overreach on rules like Waters of the U.S. Last summer, Smith’s Science Committee investigated the EPA’s creation of detailed maps showing waters and wetlands for all 50 states. The maps, which were created in 2013 shortly after EPA proposed its Waters of the U.S. rule, had never been made public. Although the EPA has claimed the maps were not used to regulate, the agency has failed to explain why the agency used taxpayer money to create them in the first place. Serious questions remain regarding the EPA's underlying motivations for creating such highly detailed maps.
05.26.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s refusal to lift the injunction against President Obama’s unilateral executive actions on immigration. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I am encouraged by today’s decision to uphold a Texas judge’s injunction preventing the Obama administration from forging ahead with unilateral amnesty actions. I will continue to be a vocal supporter of the Texas-led, 26-state lawsuit and our nation’s rule of law. The American people should also be encouraged by today’s ruling which shows that the courts are still willing to put a check on an overreaching executive branch. As the president himself has admitted, he does not have the authority to unilaterally rewrite laws.” In December, numerous states – led by the State of Texas – filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration. Congressman Smith, Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz, and Chairman Goodlatte signed an amicus brief submitted to the federal court in support of the states’ lawsuit. On February 17, 2015 a federal judge temporarily blocked President Obama’s unilateral immigration actions. Since then, political appointees at the Justice Department have filed an appeal to lift the injunction. Oral arguments were heard by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 17, 2015. Smith, Cruz, Cornyn, and Goodlatte recently filed another brief earlier this month with the support of more than 100 Members of the House and Senate. That brief was also filed to show lawmaker support for upholding the injunction keeping the federal government from implementing the president’s executive actions on immigration.
05.26.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released to following information to assist those in areas affected by storms and flooding in Central Texas. Congressman Smith: “We are saddened by the weekend's tragic storms and flooding that took lives and damaged or destroyed more than a thousand homes and businesses. I am meeting with local officials and surveying damaged areas, and my office stands ready to assist. Those in the areas affected remain in our thoughts and prayers in the coming days as communities continue recovery and cleanup efforts. “For all seeking resources after the storms and for those seeking ways to help, I hope this information is useful.” Flood Safety Avoid areas already flooded and any fast-flowing water. Be extremely cautious of any water on roads or in creeks, streams, storm drains or other areas – never attempt to cross flowing streams or drive across flooded roadways and observe road barricades placed for your protection. Remember that dangerous waters can seem deceptively calm, and if you encounter flooding, move to higher ground. Road Closures At least 900 roads have flooded at some point over the weekend, leaving many closed or unsafe to travel. Crews with Texas Department of Transportation have deployed resources to address flooding conditions and debris cleanup impacting roadways. Residents are reminded to stay off of closed roads and check www.drivetexas.org or Facebook, and Twitter for updates on road conditions. Shelters The American Red Cross has set up shelters throughout Central Texas. For updated information on shelters, please call 1-877-500-8645 or visit the blog for the Central and South Texas Region of the American Red Cross.

05.22.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in recognition of Memorial Day. Congressman Smith: “Memorial Day is a reminder of our country’s commitment to our service members, past and present, who risked all to defend our nation’s freedoms. America is a stronger country because of our Armed Services members. The 21st Congressional District is home to over 60,000 veterans, current members of the military and their families. The debt we owe them can never fully be repaid. And for that we are most grateful. “We thank each of our veterans and their families for allowing our country to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. “I am also honored to have a hand in giving Vietnam era Medal of Honor recipient Milton A. Lee the long overdue recognition he deserves. I’ve been working with VFW Post 688 in Boerne to rename the stretch of highway along I-10 in his honor. I am glad I was able to introduce this bill with signatures from each member of the Texas congressional delegation in time for Memorial Day." Smith introduced H.R. 2559 this week, a bill to rename part of Highway I-10 in Kendall County in honor of PFC Milton A. Lee, who died in combat in Vietnam on April 26, 1968 at the age of 19. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House in 1970 for ‘conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.’ He is buried at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio. Smith also announced he plans to host a veterans tele-town hall on June 3rd with Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Jeff Miller (R-Fla.).
05.15.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016, which passed in the House of Representatives. Congressman Smith: “Congress has a sacred responsibility to provide for our nation’s defense. We must never forget the sacrifices those who serve make to protect our freedom. This bill ensures our men and women in uniform have the resources they need.” The funding in the bill is consistent with the House Budget Resolution that balances the federal budget and ensures troop readiness through rigorous training, adequate facilities and well-maintained equipment. It also supports a 2.3 percent pay raise for the military and includes a new retirement system for future military service members. The system would allow new service members to contribute to a portable 401(k)-style retirement plan with matching contributions from the government of up to 5 percent of basic pay. The bill would also support the transition of troops from active-duty into veteran status by directing DoD and the VA to work in cooperation on pain management and other health issues of the 21st century. The bill would also prohibit another round of base closings, known as BRAC.
05.14.2015	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in support of H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 400- 25. Congressman Smith: “A nuclear Iran is an unacceptable risk to American security and world peace. Today I voted to ensure Congress and the American people have the final say with any deal President Obama tries to make with Iran. This is what the majority of the American people want.” A recent Pew Research poll showed that 62 percent of the American public want Congress to have final authority with any potential deal with Iran.

05.11.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) – in conjunction with the American Center for Law and Justice – today filed an amicus brief with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in support of a continued injunction against President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration in the case of Texas v. United States. The amicus brief states that the President’s unilaterally created deferred action programs for unlawful immigrants are unconstitutional and are contrary to congressional intent. A total of 88 Members of Congress and 25 Senators signed the brief. In December, numerous states – led by the State of Texas – filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration. Congressman Smith, Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz, and Chairman Goodlatte signed an amicus brief submitted to the federal court in support of the states’ lawsuit. On February 17, 2015 a federal judge temporarily blocked President Obama’s unilateral immigration actions. Since then, political appointees at the Justice Department have filed an appeal to lift the injunction. Oral arguments were heard by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 17, 2015. Congressman Smith, Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz, and Chairman Goodlatte issued the statements below after filing this brief in federal court. Congressman Smith: “We will continue to stand with the American people, the rule of law, and our Constitution. I am encouraged by today’s strong congressional support for the Texas-led, 26-state lawsuit seeking to stop the president’s executive immigration actions. I urge the courts to check the overreaching power of the executive branch. We must do everything possible to halt the president’s unprecedented and unreasonable actions.” Senator Cornyn: “President Obama’s unconstitutional immigration actions are an affront to the rule of law. Judge Hanen correctly ruled that the President exceeded his authority when he circumvented Congress to rewrite our immigration laws, and I am confident future courts will agree.” Senator Cruz: “Twenty-two times President Obama told Americans that he did not have the power to grant unilateral amnesty. And yet, the President has unlawfully granted amnesty to millions who came here illegally. A federal judge rightfully ruled against his actions, and I hope the Court of Appeals affirms this decision. President Obama’s amnesty is in defiance of the people and of Congress, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues in defense of the rule of law.” Chairman Goodlatte: “President Obama’s decision to ignore the limits placed on his power and act unilaterally to rewrite our nation’s immigration laws are an affront to the Constitution. The President himself stated over 20 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own yet he did so anyway. Such lawlessness must be stopped so that we preserve the separation of powers in the Constitution and protect individual liberty.”
05.01.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in favor of S. Con. Res. 11, the FY2016 Budget Resolution, a bill substantially similar to the balanced budget the House approved just weeks ago. Congressman Smith: “This is the first time in six years that the House and Senate have come together to pass a budget. Fixing our broken system starts with balancing our budget, establishing priorities and reining in out-of-control spending. That is exactly what this bill does. “Once again, President Obama has handed Congress a tax-and-spend, big-government budget that never balances. It ignores our growing national debt and punishes hard-working taxpayers. “We have passed a budget that cuts spending, reduces the deficit, balances the budget, and supports the men and women in uniform who are defending our nation. The budget repeals ObamaCare, ends the failed health law’s $700 billion raid on Medicare, and keeps Medicare solvent.” The Senate has said it plans to hold a vote on the House-Senate agreement next week. The resolution: Balances the budget in less than 10 years and cuts more than $5 trillion in spending. Cuts $4.2 trillion in mandatory spending by repealing Obamacare and promoting state flexibility. $32 billion surplus in 2024 and ultimately pays off the national debt. Does not raise taxes. Reconciliation instructions to House and Senate Committees with jurisdiction over Obamacare. Affirms the use of reconciliation to repeal Obamacare. Support a strong national defense and Increases defense spending above the president’s budget in both the five and ten year window. Maintains $523 billion BCA cap and provides $96 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds in 2016. Supports our military and resources necessary to counter global threats. Promotes access to patient-centered health care reform and repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board and all Obamacare taxes, regulations, and mandates. Saves, strengthens, and secures Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Supports a pro-growth and revenue neutral tax reform proposal. $400 billion in additional economic growth over the next ten years. Empowers states to reform welfare programs and improve work requirements.
04.30.2015	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) hosted Apollo astronaut and Kerrville resident Gene Cernan today for a screening of The Last Man on the Moon, a documentary on Cernan’s life. Chairman Lamar Smith: “Gene traveled from Texas to be with us this evening. He is a genuine American hero, not just for coming from Texas, but for what he’s done as an astronaut. Gene owns a ranch in Kerrville, Texas, and you’ll see some of the beauty of the Texas Hill Country in this movie. “I first met Gene Cernan when he and Neil Armstrong testified before the Science Committee in September 2011. At that hearing, Gene’s advice to young people was to ‘never stop shooting for the Moon.’ “In his autobiography, he observed: ‘Too many years have passed for me to still be the last man to have left his footprints on the Moon. I believe with all my heart that somewhere out there is a young boy or girl with indomitable will and courage who will lift that dubious distinction from my shoulders and take us back where we belong. Let us give that dream a chance.’ “Sage advice to those of us in Congress, by someone who understands the value of inspiration and his role in turning dreams into reality.” Prior to the event, Cernan also addressed lawmakers about the importance of leadership in space exploration. Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan: “This is not a film about me. It’s a film about a young man, a kid, with a dream, who was fortunate enough to be born at a time when America understood exceptionalism. It took my producer a long time to convince me to do this film. I asked him ‘Who wants to hear about me?’ And he said, ‘It’s about the story.’ So this film is not just about me, it’s about a young boy with a dream.” In addition to the screening, Smith’s Science, Space, and Technology Committee approved a two-year NASA Authorization bill Thursday that seeks to restore balance to NASA’s budget and supports space exploration systems needed to take U.S. astronauts back to the Moon or to Mars. The NASA Authorization Act for 2016 and 2017 is a budget-neutral bill that continues the consistent guidance Congress has given to NASA for nearly a decade by reaffirming a stepping stone approach to exploration. The bill’s policy provisions largely mirror that of the House-passed NASA Authorization Act of 2015, a one year bill that passed with unanimous bipartisan support in February 2015. Chairman Lamar Smith: “Today’s bill is a step in the right direction to ensure that NASA will continue to innovate and inspire. The Authorization levels for FY16 and FY17 included in this bill provide NASA with the resources necessary to remain a leader in space exploration in a time of tight budget realities. For more than 50 years, the U.S. has led the world in space exploration. We must restore balance to NASA’s budget if we want to ensure the U.S. continues to lead in space for the next 50 years. And we must continue to invest in NASA as the only government agency responsible for space exploration.” The Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership/Citizens for Spaceflight Exploration-Texas called the Committee’s bill a “strong endorsement of America’s space exploration program” because of its support of the “nation’s global national security interests, technological innovation and competitiveness, high-tech jobs and future workforce opportunities, STEM education and quality of life improvements.” The Coalition for Space Exploration, which is comprised of aerospace industry companies, said the bill “reaffirms longstanding congressional support for NASA’s Exploration Program, including the world’s only super heavy exploration rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), and deep space crew vehicle, Orion. Using these exceptional and unparalleled exploration systems, NASA will soon return American astronauts to cis-lunar space for the first time in more than 40 years and, eventually, take us to Mars. With suppliers across 48 states providing components for SLS and Orion, communities across the nation are all a part of returning American astronauts to deep space.” Planetary Society Director of Advocacy Casey Dreier has praised the Committee’s “scientifically ambitious, affordable plan of solar system exploration” as well as the bill’s “clear directives and support for [NASA’s] future exploration.” The Planetary Society, led by CEO Bill Nye, is considered one of the largest and most influential public space organizations in the world. The Commercial Spaceflight Federation (CSF), which represents more than 50 commercial space companies across the United States, also expressed its strong support for the bill, citing “the Committee’s increased support for the Commercial Crew Program” and the bill’s ability to “restore America’s capability to launch American astronauts on American rockets form American soil by 2017 and end our sole reliance on Russia.” Apollo astronaut and Kerrville, Texas, resident Gene Cernan speaks with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy prior to a screening of the film about his life, The Last Man on the Moon. House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman and Texas Congressman Lamar Smith introduces Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan before a screening of the film, The Last Man on the Moon.

04.15.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in recognition of today’s federal tax filing deadline and in support of several tax measures expected to pass in the House of Representatives this week. Congressman Smith: “Today is tax day, a day that many Americans have come to fear and loathe. As the current administration has drastically increased spending, many on the left have demanded more and more taxes to pay for this excessive spending. “I believe Texas families and job creators are better off when government lets people keep more of what they earn. To that end, I plan to support several measures in the House of Representatives this week to lower the tax burden on Americans and move toward a simpler, fairer system. “Taxes like the death tax are the reason why families can face taxes as high as 40 percent after the death of a loved one. These taxes are the reason why many family farms and small businesses must be sold, and are also part of the reason why 70 percent of businesses do not survive to the second generation. “I’ll also support a bill this week to restore the expired sales tax deduction and make it a permanent part of our tax code. This deduction is important since it would allow as many as 1 in 5 Americans, who live in states like Texas that do not have an income tax, to deduct sales tax on their federal tax returns. This change has the potential to save Texans billions of dollars. “And finally, we’ll take further actions to hold the IRS accountable for recent scandals and to restore protections for taxpayers. I am pleased to support the Taxpayer Bill of Rights to ensure taxpayers have basic legal protections when dealing with our nation’s tax enforcers, such as: the right to quality service, confidentiality, and the right to appeal an IRS decision and have their challenge be heard. This runaway federal agency must be reined in and reminded that they are here to serve the American people, and not the other way around. “So as you sit down to finish your taxes this week, know that I am committed to improving our tax system for hardworking Americans like you. You deserve a simpler, fairer tax system.” Below is a complete list of tax measures Smith plans to support this week in the House of Representatives: Repealing the Death Tax Rep. Kevin Brady’s (R-Texas) Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015 would put an end to this tax which takes up to 40 percent of a family member’s estate upon their death and has been cited as the reason for loss of family farms and businesses. Restoring the Right to Deduct State and Local Sales Tax Rep. Kevin Brady’s (R-Texas) State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2015 would allow Americans living in states like Texas to once more deduct sales tax in the place of state income tax on their federal returns. This could result in billions of dollars in savings for Texans. A Taxpayer Bill of Rights Rep. Roskam’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act would provide taxpayers with some basic protections under the law, including the right to quality service, the right to confidentiality, and the right to appeal and have their challenge be heard. “After a difficult period for the IRS,” National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson says, “a Taxpayer Bill of Rights has the potential to restore taxpayers’ trust in both the IRS and the tax system.”Keeping Federal Employees Accountable Currently, more than 100,000 federal employees owe more than $1 billion in tax debt to the federal government. Rep. Jason Chaffetz’s (R-Utah) Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015 would give agency heads the ability to fire federal employees with seriously delinquent tax debts and would also prevent the federal government from hiring individuals with seriously delinquent tax debts. Make Targeting a Firing Offense The Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act, authored by Rep. Jim Renacci (R-OH), would authorize the IRS to terminate employees who engage in political targeting. We now know that the IRS rehired hundreds of employees who were previously fired for misconduct issues. No Personal Email for Official IRS Business Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton isn’t the only high-level Obama administration official to use personal e-mail for official business. Lois Lerner also engaged in the practice, and the IRS has no outright ban on e-mailing outside its network. Rep. Kenny Marchant has (R-TX) introduced legislation to end this practice at the IRS. An Impartial, Two-Way Process Nonprofit organizations deserve a balanced, impartial, review process that is free from political influence when they apply for tax exempt status. In addition to being freed from one-sided targeting, nonprofit organizations seeking tax-exempt status deserve an impartial application review process. Legislation introduced by Rep. Pat Meehan (R-PA) would allow a nonprofit the ability to directly petition the IRS and get a fair hearing if their initial application is turned down. The Right to Know The Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act, introduced by Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), would give taxpayers the right to know the status of investigations pertaining to their personal information. This is a necessary safeguard. We now know that Lois Lerner’s division shared highly confidential tax-exempt applications with an outside organization as well as the FEC. No More Indefinite Delays The IRS Bureaucracy Reduction and Judicial Review Act, authored by Rep. George Holding (R-NC), would allow organizations to declare their tax-exempt status rather than wait for bureaucratic approval. One retired IRS veteran has admitted that the agency made many nonprofit organizations wait years to be granted tax-exempt status, without any resolution. Fair Treatment For All Gifts As part of its effort to target Americans for their political beliefs, the IRS has threatened to apply a gift tax to donations to nonprofit organizations. Rep. Roskam’s (R-Ill.) Fair Treatment for All Gifts Act will prevent this abuse of power by ensuring that all donations to nonprofit organizations are tax-free. Keeping Federal Contractors Accountable Rep. Jason Chaffetz’s (R-Utah) Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2015 would ensure no new government contracts are awarded to those with seriously delinquent tax debts. IRS Bureaucracy Reduction and Judicial Review Rep. George Holding’s (R-NC) bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code so that social welfare organizations that plan to operate as tax-exempt entities have 60 days to notify the IRS of their intent, and are allowed to request a declaratory judgment from the agency about its classification as tax-exempt.
04.09.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) this week hosted a public meeting with special guest Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. More than 200 people showed up for the event, “Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable,” which was held at the Cailloux Theater in Kerrville, Texas on the evening of Wednesday, April 8th. Congressman Smith: “The public has a right to know about the drastic and costly regulations that the EPA is crafting behind closed doors. These proposals will have far-reaching impacts that will be felt in communities all across Texas and the nation. We must ensure that our nation’s policies serve the interest of the American people – not an extreme political agenda. As chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that agencies like the EPA are operating in the most efficient, effective, and accountable manner possible.” Attendees heard from a panel of experts, including Texas Public Policy Foundation Director of the Armstrong Center for Energy & the Environment, Kathleen Hartnett White; Executive Manager for Strategic Communications and Public Affairs of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, LaMarriol Smith; General Manager and CEO of the Kerrville Public Utility Board, Tracy McCuan; Member of the Board of Directors for the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, Gordon E. Sauer; and Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. Smith recently subpoenaed the EPA after the agency refused to hand over information related to almost 6,000 deleted text messages linked to the agency’s top official, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. This is not the first time the agency has come under fire for lack of openness: in 2012, former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was caught using an alias email address, using the fake name “Richard Windsor.” Smith has also previously subpoenaed the agency for failure to turn over the underlying scientific data used for making costly regulations. On March 2, 2015, a federal court issued an opinion raising concerns about the EPA’s process for responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and calling the EPA’s handling of a 2012 FOIA request “suspicious.” The Center for Effective Government also recently gave the EPA a grade of “D” in its report for providing access to information. The House of Representatives also recently approved Smith’s Secret Science Reform Act to increase transparency and accountability at the EPA. Smith’s legislation would require the EPA to base all regulations on scientific data that is open to the public – something the agency has refused to do up to this point. A 2013 poll from the Institute of Energy Research found that 90 percent of Americans agree that studies and data used to make federal government decisions should be public. Last year, Smith exposed extensive maps of U.S. waters and wetlands that the EPA commissioned – and tried to keep hidden – while working to update its controversial Waters of the U.S. Rule. Photos from Wednesday evening’s event can be found below. Higher resolution photo can be requested by emailing Gina.Finke@mail.house.gov. Congressman Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, introduces a panel of experts at “Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable.” From left to right, participants included: Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller; Texas Public Policy Foundation Director of the Armstrong Center for Energy & the Environment, Kathleen Hartnett White; Executive Manager for Strategic Communications and Public Affairs of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, LaMarriol Smith; General Manager and CEO of the Kerrville Public Utility Board, Tracy McCuan; Member of the Board of Directors for the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, Gordon E. Sauer. Congressman Smith, chairman of the House, Science, Space and Technology Committee, fields a question from an attendee during Wednesday night’s meeting,“Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable.” More than 200 Hill Country residents attended Wednesday night’s forum, “Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable,” hosted by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) who serves as chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) discusses the potential impacts of EPA proposals with Hill Country residents following Wednesday night’s forum, “Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable.” Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) enjoyed a post-roundtable snack with students from Tivy High School who attended Wednesday night’s forum, “Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable.”
04.06.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today hosted a live television downlink with astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) at Smithson Valley High School. Congressman Smith kicked off the discussion with the space station and spoke to students about the importance of space exploration and science education. The 15-minute Earth-to-space call allowed for students to ask questions of American Astronaut Terry Virts and European Space Agency Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. Congressman Smith: “For over 14 years, NASA astronauts have lived and worked onboard the International Space Station, an amazing engineering achievement that is a partnership between 15 countries led by the United States. The ISS is in orbit 260 miles above the Earth and is traveling at 17,000 miles per hour. It is roughly the size of a football field including the end zones and has livable space to allow six astronauts to live and work there. The Space Station is a laboratory to develop new materials and medicines that make their way into the commercial products we use here on Earth.” Congressman Smith was also joined by Apollo Astronaut Charlie Duke, one of only 12 people to have walked on the Moon. Events like today are part of NASA’s Teaching from Space Program, which supports learning opportunities and builds partnerships with the education community using the unique environment of space. Congressman Smith serves as Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, which oversees programs at NASA.
03.26.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), released the following statement after voting today in favor H.R. 2, a bill to permanently repeal Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR. The bill would provide more stability for Medicare patients, and result in savings for the taxpayer. The bill passed by a vote of 392-37. Congressman Smith: “Every year, more and more doctors turn away Medicare patients because they can’t depend on the program’s unstable payment system. This is a real problem for the millions of American seniors who rely on Medicare for their health care needs. This bill puts seniors first by giving Medicare the long-term stability both doctors and patients need. And it will save taxpayers almost $1 billion over the next ten years.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) confirmed this week that H.R. 2 would also save taxpayers money compared to the current practice of temporary fixes, and put the nation’s budget on a more sustainable path. It is estimated $170 billion has been spent on patches over the last few years, costing taxpayers more than what the CBO estimates it would cost to repeal the SGR using the House bill. In addition, CBO estimates enacting H.R. 2 would cost $0.9 billion less over the 2015–2025 period than freezing payment rates for physicians’ services. It would do so by establishing the first real, structural entitlement reforms in nearly two decades – offsetting all new spending without tax increases. It will also will bring more competition to Medicare and set the stage for further reforms in the future to help seniors and taxpayers. It would also strengthen Medicare’s ability to fight fraud, waste, and abuse by, among other things, removing Social Security numbers from beneficiaries’ Medicare cards, preventing Medicare payments for deceased and ineligible individuals, and removing burdensome reporting policies for employers.
03.25.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to reports that the military will charge Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy in an Article 32 hearing Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio: Congressman Smith: “These are some of the most serious charges that can be brought against a member of the Armed Forces. If these allegations hold up in a military court, it only deepens existing concerns about the administration’s questionable deal struck last year to trade five senior Taliban officials for Sgt. Bergdahl’s release. I have confidence that the military is moving forward with this in the proper order. Several soldiers died and others risked their lives in the long search for Sgt. Bergdahl. Americans deserve to know the truth.” Fort Sam Houston is located in Rep. Smith’s congressional district in San Antonio.
03.25.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today announced he is subpoenaing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Smith has led recent efforts to increase transparency and accountability at the EPA, fight costly new EPA ozone regs, and put a check on the agency’s plans for sweeping new water rules. Smith also today announced a public event with special guest Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, “Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable.” The event will be held at the Cailloux Theater on Wednesday, April 8th, from 7 to 8:30 pm. Smith issued today’s subpoena after the agency refused to hand over information related to almost 6,000 deleted text messages linked to the agency’s top official, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. This is not the first time the agency has come under fire for lack of openness: in 2012, former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson was caught using a fake email address alias, and Smith has previously subpoenaed the agency for failure to turn over information related to costly ozone regulations. On March 2, 2015, a federal court issued an opinion raising concerns about the agency’s process for responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and calling the EPA’s handling of a 2012 FOIA request “suspicious.” And the Center for Effective Government gave the EPA a grade of “D” in its most recent report for poor performance in giving access to information. Congressman Smith: “As chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that agencies like the EPA are operating in the most efficient, effective, and accountable manner possible. We all want clean air and clean water. Yet the EPA has avoided transparency at every turn, while attempting to impose costly regulations on Americans. The EPA’s pattern of withholding, concealing and possibly destroying records must come to an end. The American people deserve an open and honest government. “That is why I am subpoenaing the EPA, and that is why I am hosting the Regulation Roundtable in Kerrville on April 8th. I invite Texans to join me at this event to share their stories and hear how we are working at the local, state, and federal level to rein in the EPA’s overreach. We need policies that serve the taxpayer, not an extreme political agenda.” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller: “I applaud Chairman Smith for calling this regulation roundtable. As Texans, we must stand together to stop EPA from enacting rules to unnecessarily regulate certain waters on our farms and ranches. This overreach will result in a total erosion of state and individual property rights. It will cripple our economy and damage the free enterprise system. Plus, it will burden our farmers, ranchers and private landowners with undue hardship. Texans understand that clean water is important. Farmers and ranchers are the original conservationists and best stewards of the land. That’s how they earn their livelihood, and they know how to protect the land far better than some bureaucrats in Washington. I look forward to hearing from Texans in the Hill Country on how we can build a coalition to protect our freedoms." WHO: Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Special guest Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller WHAT: Reining in the EPA: A Regulation Roundtable WHEN: Wednesday, April 8th, 7-8:30 PM CT WHERE: Cailloux Theater 910 Main Street Kerrville, TX 78028 Earlier this month, the House approved Smith’s Secret Science Reform Act to increase transparency and accountability at the EPA. Smith’s legislation would require the EPA to base all regulations on scientific data that is open to the public – something the agency has refused to do up to this point. A 2013 poll from the Institute of Energy Research found that 90 percent of Americans agree that studies and data used to make federal government decisions should be public. Last year, Smith exposed extensive maps of U.S. waters and wetlands that the EPA commissioned – and tried to keep hidden – while working to update its controversial Waters of the U.S. Rule. Additionally, tomorrow at 10:00 a.m., the Science Committee’s Subcommittees on Oversight and Environment will hold a hearing titled, Destruction of Records at EPA – When Records Must Be Kept. The hearing will clarify when the Federal Records Act applies to certain information and how it has been implemented at the EPA. Those wishing to attend the Regulation Roundtable are encouraged to RSVP through Smith’s website.
03.25.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in favor of H.Con. Res. 27, A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America, which passed in the House of Representatives: Congressman Smith: “For the sixth year in a row, President Obama has handed Congress a tax-and-spend, big-government budget that never balances. It ignores our growing national debt and punishes hard-working taxpayers. “House Republicans have proposed a budget that cuts spending, reduces the deficit, balances the budget, and supports the men and women in uniform who are defending our nation. The budget repeals ObamaCare, ends the failed health law’s $700 billion raid on Medicare, and keeps Medicare solvent. “Under President Obama’s failed policies, both the debt and deficit have doubled. No family, no community, no country can continue that kind of excessive spending. It is the road to bankruptcy. “A fundamental responsibility of the government is to set budgets and stick to them. This is necessary not only to keep the country running, but also to prevent it from running into the ground. It is time for the President to stop spending money the government doesn’t have and start working with Republicans to save America’s future.” The FY16 Budget Resolution, A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America, would: Balance in less than ten years – in contrast to the President whose budget never balances Cut $5.5 Trillion in spending – higher than any previous House Budget proposal Support a healthier economy today and greater economic opportunity for tomorrow Repeal Obamacare and start over Boost defense spending above the president’s levels throughout Eliminate “double dipping” of Disability Insurance and Unemployment Insurance and establish a plan to strengthen the regular Social Security Trust Fund Save and strengthen Medicare, ending the $700 billion Obamacare raid on Medicare Smith also voted for the Republican Study Budget, which would have cut spending by $7.1 trillion over 10 years. In contrast, the President’s FY16 Budget proposal would: Increase Taxes • Despite $2.1 trillion in new tax increases, President Obama’s budget never balances—ever. • Major proposed tax increases include higher levies on savings and investment, small businesses, and increases in the costs of hiring workers. • These tax hikes would stunt the economic growth needed to get Americans back to work, and come on top of $1.7 trillion in tax hikes already imposed by this Administration. Increase Spending • The President’s budget increases annually-appropriated spending for next year by $74 billion relative to current law. In over 5 years, he would increase such spending by $322 billion. • Next year alone, the President’s budget would grow total federal spending by $259 billion, or 7 percent. • Total spending will increase by 65 percent ($2.4 trillion) in 10 years under the President’s plan. Cause Interest Costs to Skyrocket • President Obama’s plan more than triples interest costs, which remain the fastest growing item in the budget. • Interest on the debt this year would be $229 billion, but would rise to $785 billion in 2025 under his plan. • At the end of President’s plan, annual interest costs would be larger than his proposed spending for national defense, Medicaid or the combined total of all non-defense agency spending. Increase the Debt • Since 2009, we’ve added $7.5 trillion to the debt and spent $21.1 trillion. • The President’s budget plan would add $8.5 trillion to the debt. • Cumulative deficits would amount to $5.7 trillion, and gross debt would climb to $26.3 trillion in 2025.
03.20.2015	Congressman Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in support of immigration enforcement bills he helped author and pass on the House Judiciary Committee this week. Congressman Smith: “The president’s unilateral, unconstitutional immigration actions last fall were unprecedented. Previous actions invited the deadly surge at our Southern border. We must restore the rule of law and right the wrongs this president has inflicted on the American people and on our immigration system. This week, I worked to pass two bills on the House Judiciary Committee to restore our rule of law and strengthen enforcement. “Congressman Trey Gowdy’s Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act empowers local and state law enforcement with the ability to enforce our immigration laws. The result would be that our immigration laws are upheld even in cases where the president attempts to tie the hands of federal enforcement agencies, as he did last November with his executive amnesty. “Congressman Jason Chaffetz’s Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act would ensure that only those who qualify for asylum receive it. The current administration has exploited existing laws to open our borders wide to any and all who come here illegally. Our bill restores the law to its rightful purpose to grant asylum only for reasons of credible fear on a limited, case-by-case basis. “These bills, in addition to my Legal Workforce Act and the Protection of Children Act, are the policies that Congress must enact to strengthen and reinforce current immigration laws.”
03.19.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to an admission this week from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that the agency released 30,558 criminal immigrants in 2014. Congressman Smith: “When the president attempted to unilaterally and unconstitutionally rewrite our immigration laws, he also eliminated a highly successful program that takes criminal illegal immigrants off our streets and sends them back home. That the Obama administration released more than 30,000 criminal illegal immigrants into our communities last year endangers the lives and property of innocent Americans. “This would be considered the worst prison break in American history except it was sanctioned by the president and implemented by our own immigration officials. These criminal immigrants should have been deported to ensure that they could never commit crimes in the U.S. Instead, ICE officials chose not to detain them and released them back on to American streets. “If the Obama Administration would spend half as much time protecting Americans as it does protecting illegal immigrants from deportation, our communities would be much safer. If President Obama will not deport immigrants who are here illegally and have committed crimes, who will he deport?” In 2013, ICE released more than 36,000 criminal immigrants, including individuals convicted of murder, rape, kidnapping, and drunk driving. The 36,000 criminals had 88,000 convictions, including 193 homicide convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 9,187 dangerous drug convictions, and 16,070 drunk or drugged driving convictions. The president took further actions to end the successful Secure Communities program in his November executive amnesty memos, even as he promised to prioritize the deportation of felons. Secure Communities uses an already-existing federal-information sharing partnership between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to identify criminal aliens so that ICE can take enforcement action.
03.18.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) – in conjunction with the American Center for Law and Justice – today filed an amicus brief with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in support of the federal district court’s decision to halt President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration in Texas vs. the United States. In December, 26 states – led by the State of Texas – filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration, and Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman Smith, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Cruz signed an amicus brief submitted to the federal court in support of the states’ lawsuit. On February 17, 2015 a federal judge temporarily blocked President Obama’s unilateral immigration actions in order to give the lawsuit time to make its way through the judicial system. Since then, political appointees at the Justice Department have filed an appeal. Congressman Smith, Chairman Goodlatte, and Senator Cornyn issued the statements below after the brief was filed in court: Congressman Smith: “Our Constitution gives the courts a crucial check on the powers of the executive branch. This lawsuit is a necessary response to the president’s unreasonable and unprecedented actions. This isn’t about Republicans or Democrats; it’s about respecting the rule of law. I stand firmly with the Texas-led, 26-state lawsuit and the Texas federal court that has put a temporary halt to the president’s executive amnesty orders. The president acted contrary to the Constitution and must be held accountable.” Chairman Goodlatte: “President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration poses a clear and present danger to our Constitution and it’s imperative that the President’s actions continue to be blocked so that the states’ lawsuit can move forward in the courts. President Obama stated himself over 20 times that he does not have the authority to change our immigration laws, yet he went ahead and did it anyway. Such an unprecedented power grab undermines the separation of powers in the Constitution and imperils individual liberty. We must do all that we can to stop President Obama’s lawlessness.” Senator Cornyn: “As I have said all along and a federal court affirmed, President Obama exceeded his authority when he went around Congress to unilaterally change our nation’s immigration laws. But since the Administration refuses to obey the court’s ruling, we will continue to fight to reverse the President's unconstitutional overreach and respect the rule of law.”
03.17.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith, chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee today held a hearing to examine the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. Despite the fact that many communities have struggled to meet current ozone standards, the Obama administration insists on pursuing an even stricter regulatory agenda. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “The air we breathe is significantly cleaner and will continue to improve thanks to new technologies. However, it is premature and unnecessary for the EPA to propose a new standard when we have not yet given states the opportunity to meet the 2008 standard. These proposed standards are impossible to meet in some places and are likely to have little or no impact. Implementation of this rule will cost billions of dollars and adversely affect many Americans. These are the wrong regulations at the wrong time.” The EPA has argued that it has scientific data to justify its regulations, but has refused to base regulations on data that is publicly available. The House will vote as early as Wednesday on Smith’s Secret Science Reform Act, which would require the EPA to base all regulations on data that is already public. A recent poll from the Institute of Energy Research found that 90 percent of Americans agree that studies and data used to make federal government decisions should be public. The agency’s ozone proposal seeks to make new rules even more stringent than regulations put in place in 2008, which many communities have struggled to meet. Others have never met the standards set in 1979. In 2010, businesses and communities across the country protested the EPA’s efforts to tighten these standards. The overwhelming concerns eventually forced President Obama to withdraw the proposal. Today’s witnesses discussed how this proposed rule will impact American small businesses and job creation. According to analysis by the Business Roundtable, nearly 60 percent of Americans would live in areas of non-attainment, including 45 of 50 states that would be completely or partially violating the standard. Witnesses said that a non-attainment designation under the Clean Air Act would stop new employers from moving into the state and halt expansion and economic development. In addition to higher energy prices, according to a February 2015 National Economic Research Associates comprehensive study, average annual household consumption could be reduced by $830 per household per year. The following witnesses testified today: Mr. Harry C. Alford, President and CEO, National Black Chamber of Commerce Mr. Ray Keating, Chief Economist, Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council Dr. Mary B. Rice, Instructor in Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Pulmonary and Critical Care Physician, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Dr. Allen S. Lefohn, President, A.S.L. & Associates Mr. Eldon Heaston, Executive Director, Mojave Desert and Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District For additional information about today’s hearing, including witness testimony and the archived webcast, visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
03.14.2015	SAN ANTONIO — Congressman Lamar Smith today participated in the FIRST Robotics Alamo Regional Championship in San Antonio. Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, delivered opening remarks for the robotics competition. More than 3,000 students, parents, and teachers attended the regional competition. Chairman Smith: “You can’t have innovation without advances in technology. And the STEM students of today will lead us to the cutting-edge technologies of tomorrow. I was pleased to participate in this competition that allows students to showcase their talents.” As Chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Smith recently led efforts to pass a STEM education bill in the House of Representatives by a vote of 412-8. The bill strengthens ongoing science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education efforts at our federal science agencies and ensures computer science is included in these efforts. Math enthusiasts also recognized Saturday, March 14th, as “Pi Day” for its correlation to the Greek math ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159. Smith visits with students of TMI-Episcopal School’s “Pink Panthers” 6th grade robotics team from San Antonio, Texas. Smith delivers opening remarks to more than 3,000 students, parents, and teachers at the FIRST Robotics Alamo Regional Championship on Saturday, March 14th, 2015.
03.10.2015	Congressman Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives today reversed its attempts to ban the M855 "green tip" ammo used by AR-15 owners. Congressman Smith: “I welcome the ATF’s decision to abandon its backdoor ban on bullets. Their plan would have infringed upon the Second Amendment rights of millions of law-abiding gun owners. I will continue to oppose any and all efforts by this administration to undermine the constitutional freedoms guaranteed to every citizen.” The agency’s reversal comes after Smith and 238 other members sent a bipartisan letter of protest to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Director B. Todd Jones last week. Americans own more than five million AR-15s, which are the most commonly used rifles for sports shooting as well as home protection. The ammunition used for the AR-15 has been exempted under federal law for sporting purposes for over 30 years, which allows it to be lawfully manufactured, imported, and sold on the civilian market in the United States. But the ATF recently announced a “Framework” with the intention to ban the manufacture and importation of the second-most common ammunition used for the AR-15, the M855 or “green tip.” In the letter, Members of Congress wrote that the ATF’s “Framework” “establishes an unduly restrictive standard, does not comport with the letter or spirit of the law, and will interfere with Second Amendment rights by disrupting the market for ammunition that law abiding Americans use for sporting and other legitimate purposes.” The letter also expressed concern that the agency’s “Framework” was not published in the federal register, which is required when the Executive Branch creates a new rule. The letter and list of Members who signed it can be found here.
03.05.2015	Congressman Smith (R-Texas) today joined in sending a bipartisan letter of concern to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Director B. Todd Jones about the Obama Administration’s plan to ban a popular bullet used for the AR-15. The House Judiciary Committee letter was led by Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.) and included signatures from 239 Members of Congress. Americans own more than five million AR-15s, which are the most commonly used rifles for sports shooting as well as home protection. The ammunition used for the AR-15 has been exempted under federal law for sporting purposes for over 30 years, which allows it to be lawfully manufactured, imported, and sold on the civilian market in the United States. But the ATF recently announced a “Framework” with the intention to ban the manufacture and importation of the second-most common ammunition used for the AR-15, the M855 or “green tip.” In the letter, Members of Congress write that the ATF’s “Framework” “establishes an unduly restrictive standard, does not comport with the letter or spirit of the law, and will interfere with Second Amendment rights by disrupting the market for ammunition that law abiding Americans use for sporting and other legitimate purposes.” The letter also expresses concern that the agency’s “Framework” was not published in the federal register, which is required when the Executive Branch creates a new rule.

03.04.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement regarding today’s oral argument of King v. Burwell before the Supreme Court. At issue in the case are key provisions in the health care law that could put an end to billions of dollars in ObamaCare tax subsidies. Congressman Smith: “ObamaCare is bad enough to begin with. But this administration’s inconsistent implementation and many unfulfilled promises have created headache after headache for the American people. This week, the Supreme Court will hear another case that could strike down key provisions in this very bad law. If it does, the White House has said it has no plan to help Americans left in the lurch. Americans want more affordable insurance and more patient-centered choices. Our plan would do just that while ditching the Washington mandates that are plaguing American families and our economy.” Smith has repeatedly voted to repeal the unpopular health law. A bill he supported in February not only repealed ObamaCare, but also instructed House Committee Chairmen to work on better solutions to reform health care in America. A recent Politico poll found that only 18 percent of Americans believe their quality of care will get better with ObamaCare. And 57 percent believe that their costs will rise under ObamaCare, while only 7 percent believe ObamaCare will reduce their health care costs. Smith also has held hearings on the significant issues with the ObamaCare sign-up website healthcare.gov.
03.04.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith, (R-Texas) released the following statement after voting this week in favor of two bills sponsored by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller. Congressman Smith: “These bills represent our ongoing efforts to improve veteran care and repair a broken system. The Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act would open up more choices for veterans outside of a traditional nursing home setting. Another bill would give the Secretary of the VA the ability to recoup employee bonuses for poor performance. Despite numerous scandals across the country, VA executives are more likely to have received a taxpayer-funded bonus in the last year than any sort of disciplinary action. This is the kind of culture we must work to end at the VA in order to restore accountability and quality care for our veterans. “These are common-sense bills that I am proud to support.” The Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act would give veterans more choices for long-term care options outside of a traditional nursing home setting, such as medical foster home care. According to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) preliminary estimates, the bill would result in cost savings of $248 million over fiscal years 2015-2020. The VA does not currently have the authority to pay for veterans’ medical foster home care. This creates a situation where many service-connected veterans with limited financial resources are unable to access the medical foster home they desire because of limited financial resources. Instead, these veterans often move into nursing homes, at a much greater expense to VA. Another bill, H.R. 280, would empower the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary to recoup bonuses from VA employees for causes such as mismanagement and negligence. The VA paid more than $380,000 in cash bonuses to top executives at 38 hospitals that are under investigation for falsifying wait times for medical care. To date, 104 senior executives have had their performance ratings deferred due to pending investigations. Currently, VA has no authority to recoup bonuses for its employees, even if it’s later discovered that bonuses were awarded under false pretenses or based on incorrect performance data.
03.03.2015	The House Judiciary Committee today voted to approve Congressman Lamar Smith’s (R-Texas) Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 1147). The bill would preserve jobs for legal workers by requiring U.S. employers to check the work eligibility of all future hires through the E-Verify system. The Legal Workforce Act is supported by Numbers USA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Restaurant Association, the National Association of Homebuilders, the International Franchise Association, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Leading Builders of America. Congressman Smith: “The Legal Workforce Act turns off the jobs magnet that attracts so many illegal immigrants to the United States. The bill expands the E-Verify system and applies it to all U.S. employers. “Equally important, the American people support E-Verify. Polls show that from 71% to 85% of voters ‘support Congress passing new legislation that strengthens the rules making it illegal for businesses in the U.S. to hire illegal immigrants.’ In fact, E-Verify receives the most public support of any proposed immigration reform. “This bill is a common sense approach that will reduce illegal immigration and save jobs for legal workers. It deserves the support of everyone who wants to put the interests of American workers first.” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) also praised today’s Committee vote. Chairman Goodlatte: “The Legal Workforce Act brings our nation’s employment eligibility system into the 21st century. Rather than relying on the current paper-based I-9 system that is susceptible to fraud, this bill requires all U.S. employers to use a web-based system, E-Verify. This program takes less than two minutes to use and easily identifies whether or not a new employee is allowed to work in the United States. “Expanding E-Verify nationwide is a critical component to the interior enforcement of our immigration laws and will help maintain the integrity of our immigration system for the years ahead. In contrast to the 1986 immigration law, the Legal Workforce Act provides a tangible way to make sure our laws are enforced. Under the Legal Workforce Act, present and future administrations will no longer be able to turn off immigration enforcement efforts unilaterally. Instead, the bill ensures that where the federal government fails to act, the states can pick up the slack by empowering them to help enforce the law.” Created in 1996 and operated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), E-Verify checks the social security numbers of newly hired employees against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records to help ensure that they are genuinely eligible to work in the U.S. The program quickly confirms 99.7% of work-eligible employees and takes less than two minutes to use. Approximately 580,000 American employers currently use E-Verify and nearly 6 in 10 of America’s smallest businesses believe every employer should have to use E-Verify. Additionally, 71% to 85% of Americans support requiring all U.S. employers to use E-Verify. Components of the Legal Workforce Act: Repeals I-9 System: The Legal Workforce Act repeals the current paper-based I-9 system and replaces it with a completely electronic work eligibility check, bringing the process into the 21st century. However if an employer chooses to keep using the paper-based I-9 system they may do so. Gradual Phase-In: Phases-in mandatory E-Verify participation for new hires in six month increments beginning on the date of enactment. Within six months of enactment, businesses having more than 10,000 employees are required to use E-Verify. Within 12 months of enactment, businesses having 500 to 9,999 employees are required to use E-Verify. Eighteen months after enactment, businesses having 20 to 499 employees must use E-Verify. And 24 months after enactment, businesses having 1 to 19 employees must use E-Verify. Allows a one-time six month extension of the initial phase-in. It also provides that employees performing “agricultural labor or services” are subject to an E-Verify check within 36 months of the date of enactment. Voluntary Use: Allows employers to use E-Verify to check the work eligibility of their current employees as long as they do so in a nondiscriminatory manner and of all employees who are in the same geographic location or in the same job category. States as Partners: Preempts duplicative state laws mandating E-Verify use but gives states prominent roles in enforcing the law. Specifically, it retains the ability of states and localities to condition business licenses on the requirement that the employer use E-Verify in good faith under federal law. In addition, the bill allows states to enforce the federal E-Verify requirement and incentivizes them to do so by letting them keep the fines they recover from employers who violate the law. Protects Against Identity Theft: The bill allows individuals to lock their Social Security number (SSN) so that it can’t be used by another person to get a job. It also allows parents or legal guardians to lock the SSN of their minor children. And if a SSN shows a pattern of unusual multiple use, DHS is required to lock the SSN and alert the owner that their personal information may have been compromised. Safe Harbor: Grants employers safe harbor from prosecution if they use the E-Verify program in good faith, and through no fault of their own, receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation. Strengthened Penalties: The bill raises penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants in violation of the requirements of the bill. The bill also creates a penalty for individuals (employees or employers) who knowingly submit false information to the E-Verify system. Identity Authentication Pilot Programs: The bill requires DHS to conduct at least two pilot programs aimed at using technology within the E-Verify system to help further prevent identity theft in the system. In a short video, Congressman Smith explains how to use E-Verify. Learn more about E-Verify here and the House Judiciary Committee’s work on immigration here.
03.03.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after voting against funding for the president’s unlawful executive actions. Congressman Smith: “This is not a fight that Republicans picked. This is not even about Republicans or Democrats: it’s about the rule of law. The president himself has repeatedly admitted more than twenty times that he lacked the constitutional authority to take the executive amnesty actions he took. The president cannot simply rewrite laws on his own and expect Congress and the American people to look the other way. “In January the House voted to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security while putting a stop to the president’s unilateral, unlawful executive actions. This was a reasonable response to the president’s unreasonable, extreme overreach. Yet Senate Democrats – several of whom condemned the president’s actions – acted to prevent any debate or action on that bill. Today’s vote is being hailed as a victory for the president; it is truly a defeat for the American people and the Constitution. “This fight must continue in the courts. A Texas-led lawsuit includes 26 states who have stepped forward to hold this president’s power in check, and a Texas judge has acted to halt the implementation of these unlawful executive actions. I will continue to support these efforts in the hope that constitutional interests will prevail.” Smith has consistently voted multiple times to defund the president’s executive actions. He also is supporting a Texas-led, 26-state lawsuit, which led to a Texas judge’s ruling to halt implementation of the president’s actions.
03.03.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered an address before Congress. Smith also met today with a group of Texas members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Congressman Smith: “Israel is our strongest democratic ally in the Middle East. For decades, our nations have stood side by side against great evil in the world. Now, in the face of the Islamic State and increasing terrorism sponsored by states such as Iran, we must continue to stand together as strong allies. A nuclear Iran is an unacceptable risk to American and Israeli security and world peace.” Above, Congressman Smith meets with Texas members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee who were in town this week for the national chapter’s annual conference.
02.28.2015	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after voting against funding President Obama's executive amnesty actions. Congressman Smith: “While I support funding for the Department of Homeland Security, I oppose funding the president's unconstitutional executive actions giving amnesty to five million illegal immigrants. The president cannot simply rewrite laws on his own and expect Congress and the American people to look the other way.” Last month, Smith voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security through the end of the fiscal year while also putting a stop to the president's unlawful executive actions. Senate Democrats have blocked a vote on the House-passed legislation.
02.27.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith, (R-Texas), former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, today introduced the Legal Workforce Act and three other immigration enforcement measures to be considered by the House Judiciary Committee. Smith’s bill, which would expand the use of the E-Verify system, would ensure jobs are preserved for Americans and legal workers. Congressman Smith: “The Legal Workforce Act is crucial legislation that puts legal workers first and enjoys broad support with the American public. It is also free, quick, easy-to-use and effective. “Almost 20 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, seven million people are working in the United States illegally. By expanding the E-Verify system, this bill will ensure that jobs only go to legal workers.” A recent Paragon Insights poll showed that 71 percent of voters support Congress passing new legislation that strengthens the rules making it illegal for businesses in the U.S. to hire illegal immigrants. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this month Smith described The Legal Workforce Act as a tool that “turns off the jobs magnet that attracts so many illegal immigrants to the United States.” The bill would require all U.S. employers to use E-Verify. E-Verify is a web-based system that checks the Social Security numbers of newly hired employees against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records to help ensure that they are genuinely eligible to work in the U.S. Today, nearly 575,000 American employers voluntarily use E-Verify, and an average of 1,400 new businesses sign up each week for E-Verify. The E-Verify system is quick and effective, confirming 99.7% of work-eligible employees. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) also praised the package of bills: “The bills introduced by Representatives Gowdy, Smith, Chaffetz, and Carter end many of the Obama Administration’s disastrous polices that wreak havoc on our immigration system and strengthen the interior enforcement of our immigration laws.” In addition to The Legal Workforce Act, Smith joined Judiciary Republicans in introducing legislation to strengthen the interior enforcement of our immigration laws, remove the ability of the President to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement, reform the United States’ asylum laws, and make sure unaccompanied alien minors who make the dangerous trek to the United States are safely returned home. The four bills will be marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, March 3 and Wednesday, March 4, 2015. A summary of Smith’s bill can be found here.
02.26.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and members of the House Judiciary Committee in sending a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman (FCC) Tom Wheeler expressing deep concern with the FCC’s approval of net neutrality rules. The members signing the letter also noted that the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on the impact of the FCC’s rule change on March 17, 2015. In the letter, members invited Chairman Wheeler to testify at the upcoming hearing and noted that legislation might be necessary to ensure antitrust laws are the preferred enforcement method against anticompetitive conduct on the Internet. In addition to Congressman Smith, the letter was signed by Chairman Goodlatte, Representatives Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Steve King (R-Iowa), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Ted Poe (R-Texas), Tom Marino (R-Pa.), Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), Doug Collins (R-Ga.), Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), Mimi Walters (R-Calif.), Ken Buck (R-Colo.), John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), Dave Trott (R-Mich.), and Mike Bishop (R-Mich.). Below are excerpts from the letter. To read the entire letter, click here. “The Commission’s actions today threaten the future viability of the Internet and America’s ability to compete in the global technology marketplace. Today’s rules do not offer an enduring solution, only a partisan headline for a partisan initiative that is destined for years of litigation, generating years of debilitating uncertainty. “The assertion that these rules will ‘foster innovation and competition’ lacks factual or historical support. Witness testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on this very issue detailed the many instances in which regulation of the kind manifested by Title II and the Commission’s new rules stifled competition, including in the context of both railroad transportation and long-distance telephone networks. Indeed, it was antitrust law, not regulation, which ultimately introduced competition to the long-distance telephone market. “The Committee on the Judiciary will take every action necessary to ensure that the Internet remains a free, competitive marketplace.”
02.25.2015	The House of Representatives today approved the bipartisan STEM Education Act of 2015 (H.R. 1020), introduced by Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.). The bill strengthens ongoing science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education efforts at our federal science agencies and ensures computer science is included in these efforts. The bill passed with broad bipartisan support by a vote of 412-8. Video of Chairman Smith’s remarks on the House floor can be found here. Chairman Lamar Smith: “We need to ensure that our nation’s youth have the scientific and mathematical skills to strive and thrive in a technology-based economy. But we have to capture and hold the desire of young adults to study STEM subjects so they will want to pursue these careers. A healthy and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects, including computer science, is critical to American industries. A well-educated and trained STEM workforce ensures our future economic prosperity.” Innovation cannot take place without advances in technology. Unfortunately, America lags behind many other nations when it comes to STEM education. American students rank 21st in science and 26th in math among the top 34 developed countries of the world. Rep. Elizabeth Esty: “Our country is built on the innovation and entrepreneurship of all Americans. We must support educational and economic foundations that encourage this innovation, and today’s bipartisan passage of our STEM Education Act brings us one step closer to that goal. I hear from manufacturers, high-tech companies, and small businesses across all sectors that struggle to find workers with the necessary technical and critical problem-solving skills to fill jobs in demand. Strong support for STEM education in K-12 education will help prepare our children for good-paying jobs in high-demand fields like manufacturing, health and biomedical industries, energy, and information technology. I’m grateful to join my colleague and friend Chairman Smith in these efforts, and I look forward to working towards consideration of the STEM Education Act in the U.S. Senate.” The STEM Education Act of 2015 directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to continue to award competitive merit-reviewed grants to support informal STEM education. Informal education is work that takes place outside of the classroom to engage students in STEM subjects and fields. It also amends the NSF Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship program to allow teachers in pursuit of Master’s degrees to participate in the program. Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock (R-Va.): “STEM education holds the key for our students to compete against the best and the brightest around the world. The STEM Education Act of 2015 is a bipartisan piece of legislation that strengthens STEM education and promotes innovation and opportunity for all to be prepared for the jobs of the 21st century.” The STEM Education Coalition, STEM4US!, and Code.org sent letters in support of the bill.
02.24.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after President Obama vetoed legislation passed in both the House and Senate that would allow the Keystone XL pipeline to be built. Smith has held hearings on the House Science Committee regarding the pipeline and has repeatedly voted to move forward with the project. Congressman Smith: “Keystone has become more than a pipeline. It’s a symbol of President Obama’s unwillingness to put American jobs first. He has gone against the will of the American people by vetoing Keystone’s 42,000 jobs. It’s time for the president to put the interests of the American people ahead of the agenda of an extreme wing of his party.” The Keystone XL pipeline has been under review for more than six years. Congressman Smith represents the 21st District of Texas. He was named the most effective lawmaker in the 112th Congress when he served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He also serves on the Committee on Homeland Security and as chairman of the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee.
02.20.2015	San Antonio - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to the Obama administration’s announcement that it will seek an emergency court order to move forward with implementation of the president’s executive actions on immigration that were announced last November. Congressman Smith: “It comes as no surprise that the most partisan and imposing Department of Justice of our time would rush to defend the president's lawless actions. Putting a stop to these overreaching executive actions isn't about Republicans or Democrats; it's about respecting and restoring the rule of law. This is why it's even more important that Senate Democrats stop playing politics with the Constitution and stop blocking House legislation that would halt the president's executive overreach.” Today’s announcement comes on the heels of a Texas judge’s injunction issued earlier this week that effectively halted implementation of President Obama’s sweeping and unprecedented executive actions on immigration. Smith recently voted to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security while defunding the president’s executive actions. He has also supported a Texas-led, 26-state lawsuit and joined 169 other members of Congress in sending a letter last week urging Senate Democrats to pass the House legislation.
02.17.2015	San Antonio - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to a Texas injunction to temporarily block President Obama’s executive actions on immigration. Congressman Smith: “This isn’t about Republicans or Democrats; it’s about respecting the rule of law. I am glad that a Texas federal court is putting a temporary halt to the president’s executive amnesty orders. The president himself, a former constitutional law professor, has said 22 times he can’t do what he attempted with his executive orders. The courts will continue to play a key role in this debate as 26 states move forward with a Texas-led lawsuit against the president’s executive actions.” “Only Congress can make laws. The House has taken action to restore our rule of law and the American people’s trust in their representative government. Senate Democrats must stop playing politics with the Constitution and stop blocking House legislation that would put an end to the president’s unlawful actions.” In addition to voting to defund the president’s executive actions and supporting a Texas-led, 26-state lawsuit, Smith also joined 169 other members of Congress in sending a letter last week urging Senate Democrats to pass House legislation that would fully fund the Department of Homeland Security while defunding the president’s unilateral executive orders.
02.13.2015	House Border Security Caucus Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined 169 other House Republicans in sending a letter to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) demanding him to stop censoring debate on a critical bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security’s operations for Fiscal Year 2015 and defund unconstitutional programs created unilaterally by President Obama. These signatures were gathered in about 24 hours. In their letter, the Republican Members of Congress note that Senate Democrats have repeatedly obstructed even debating this bill in order to protect President Obama’s unconstitutional acts and shield Senate Democrats – many of whom have publicly stated that they oppose the President’s unilateral actions – from voting on the substance of the House-passed bill. Below is the text of the letter to Senator Reid. The signed letter can be found here. Dear Minority Leader Reid, We write to express our strong concern that Senate Democrats are blocking debate on a critical bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security’s operations for Fiscal Year 2015 and defund unconstitutional programs created unilaterally by President Obama. Three times, you and other members of your caucus have prevented even a debate of the House-passed Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill. While we understand that you and many of your Democrat colleagues are opposed to the provisions in the House-passed bill that would defund President Obama’s effective rewriting of our immigration laws, you should at least support debating the merits of such an important funding bill and offer amendments to the provisions you wish to change. However, you have repeatedly obstructed even debating this bill in order to protect President Obama’s unconstitutional acts and shield Senators of your party – many of whom have publicly stated that they oppose the President’s unilateral actions – from voting on the substance of the House-passed bill. It is utterly appalling that you and other Senate Democrats believe that protecting the President’s unconstitutional actions is more important than funding a Department tasked with keeping Americans safe. By preventing the Senate from taking up the House-passed bill, you are also denying the American people a fair debate on this issue. And a fair debate is what the American people want – they fundamentally disagree with President Obama’s actions and believe that he has unlawfully acted alone. For example, a Washington Post/ABC News poll last month found that 57% of registered voters believe that President Obama’s grant of deferred action should be blocked. President Obama’s actions are tilting the scales of our government in the executive’s favor, threatening to unravel our system of checks and balances and imperiling all our liberties. The House of Representatives has acted decisively to defend the Constitution from this clear and present danger by voting to defund the president’s executive actions. For the sake of our nation, our two bodies must stand together on a bipartisan basis. But in order to do this, the Senate Democrat caucus must cease to play politics with the Constitution. You must end your filibuster of the House-passed bill and allow it to proceed to the floor for consideration. History will record our actions and how we honor the trust placed in all of us by the American people.

02.12.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s request for Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF): Congressman Lamar Smith: "The extremists of the Islamic State have shown time and again they have no regard for human life or the rule of law. The brutal murders of multiple Americans and civilians from across the world show what these terrorists will do. This is pure evil. We must defeat the terrorists who call themselves the Islamic State. "It is clear that the president has greatly underestimated ISIS, just as he underestimated that terrorist groups would be emboldened by his removal of U.S. forces from Iraq. We have heard words before, but words alone are not enough. We are still waiting to hear the president’s strategy for success that will destroy and defeat ISIS. The president’s request this week does not appear to be strong enough to ensure that success. I will consult with colleagues in Congress - and my constituents – as we consider the president’s request for additional authorities.”
02.11.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in favor of a bill to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The bill, which originated in the House and has also been approved by the Senate, will now be sent to President Obama’s desk. Congressman Smith: “President Obama has consistently ignored the facts and the American people when it comes to the Keystone XL pipeline. The Obama Administration’s own State Department has said that this project would create more than 42,000 jobs. And despite the president’s unreasonable opposition, recent polls show overwhelming public support for moving forward with this pipeline. I urge the president to listen to the American people and reverse his extreme position on Keystone.” “We must continue to do everything in our power to preserve America’s energy security and support our domestic markets. Now is not the time to place additional regulatory and tax burdens on America’s energy producers.” Despite public support for the Keystone XL pipeline, the president has repeatedly stated he will veto the legislation. And in his most recent budget request to Congress, President Obama once more proposed raising taxes on the oil and gas industry by more than $44 billion. The Keystone XL pipeline has been under review for more than six years.
02.10.2015	Members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee today praised House passage of the NASA Authorization Act of 2015, legislation intended to reaffirm Congress’s commitment to NASA as a multi mission agency with programs in science, aeronautics, exploration, and human spaceflight, and make clear that Mars should be NASA’s primary goal. The bill was introduced by Space Subcommittee Chairman Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), and was also sponsored by House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), Space Subcommittee Ranking Member Donna Edwards (D-Md.), and Space Subcommittee Vice-Chair Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “The NASA Authorization Act of 2015 helps ensure that the United States will continue its proud tradition of being a world leader in space exploration. For more than 50 years, the U.S. has led the world in space exploration. The U.S. was the first nation to put a human on the moon. And NASA’s Voyager 1, an American space mission, was the first human-made object to enter interstellar space. “Our astronauts are national heroes. Alan Shepherd, John Glenn, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Sally Ride are household names. And today’s astronauts inspire American students to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and to reach for the stars. Space exploration is an investment in our nation’s future - often our long-term future. This bill expresses bipartisan confidence in America’s space initiatives.” Space Subcommittee Chairman Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.): “In a time of partisanship on Capitol Hill, both Republicans and Democrats came together to craft legislation that moves beyond congressional districts and parochial interests. I know many of our colleagues agree that American leadership in space is a matter of both national pride and national security. We are committed to once more launching American astronauts, on American rockets, from American soil. “This bill provides clear and consistent guidance to NASA. It requires the agency to develop an exploration roadmap and provides a framework to build an executable plan for future exploration efforts. NASA must use this plan to find the most efficient and effective ways to build technologies and capabilities within constrained budgets.” The NASA Authorization Act of 2015 authorizes funding consistent with the Consolidated and Further Appropriations Act of 2015. The bill continues the consistent guidance Congress has given to NASA for nearly a decade by reaffirming a stepping stone approach to exploration. The bill focuses NASA’s efforts to develop a capability to access the International Space Station so that America can once again launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil. It also increases support for the Space Launch System and the Orion Crew Vehicle – systems being developed to take astronauts to deep-space destinations like Mars – in an attempt to keep the programs on schedule for a 2017 launch date. The bill also supports a healthy science directorate that reflects input from the scientific community and an aeronautics research directorate that contributes to our nation’s aerospace economy. More details on the bill can be found here. The full text of the bill can be found here. Letters of support for the bill from the Planetary Society and the Planetary Science Institute
02.05.2015	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas, the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation to reduce frivolous lawsuits that bog down the United States legal system and cost businesses billions of dollars every year. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act would impose mandatory sanctions for lawyers who file meritless suits in federal court. Federal rules requiring sanctions for frivolous suits were watered down in 1993, which resulted in increased lawsuit abuse. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores the mandatory sanctions which hold attorneys accountable for lawsuit abuse. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia is an original cosponsor of the bill. “Lawsuit abuse is common in America because the lawyers who bring these frivolous cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Lawyers can file meritless lawsuits, and defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys’ fees or a settlement out of court. This is legalized extortion. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by imposing mandatory sanctions on attorneys who file worthless lawsuits. LARA ensures that our justice system is not just another tool for those who line their pockets by filing frivolous suits. I look forward to working with Senator Grassley to get this good bill passed in the House and the Senate and sent to the president’s desk,” Smith said. “Law-abiding Americans with a legitimate legal grievance are entitled to their day in court, but unscrupulous attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits stand in the way of valid claims and clog our legal system. Moreover, they end up hurting businesses that must devote resources to unnecessary legal expenses. Putting the brakes on frivolous lawsuits will go a long way towards balancing the scales of justice, upholding the rule of law, and improving the public good. The serious threat of punishment for filing frivolous lawsuits that would be enacted with our bill will help to deter these baseless suits,” Grassley said. “Frivolous, baseless lawsuits have no place in the courtroom. Innocent victims have been left with legal costs from frivolous lawsuits with no guarantee of compensation, which has formed the basis for the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act’s much-needed provisions. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act is an important step in reducing unnecessary and abusive litigation. Attorneys should not be rewarded for filing baseless lawsuits and this bill prohibits such abuse. This bill restores accountability and trust in the legal system, penalizes lawyers for filing baseless lawsuits, and protects victims by a full-compensation guarantee for accrued legal costs. I applaud Representative Smith for introducing this important legislation," Goodlatte said. Every year, billions of dollars are wasted on frivolous lawsuits, forcing individuals and businesses to spend thousands of dollars on litigation. This ultimately costs jobs and damages the economy because money that could be spent hiring new employees or investing in new businesses is instead directed toward legal fees. The annual direct cost of American tort litigation has been estimated at more than $250 billion. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to the U.S. legal system by providing penalties for filing baseless, meritless and frivolous lawsuits. Specifically, the bill: Reinstates sanctions for the violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which was originally intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party. Ensures that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits, including the attorney’s fees and costs incurred by the victim of the frivolous lawsuit. Reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow parties and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims by withdrawing them within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been served. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act is also cosponsored by Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and representatives Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Small Business Committee, Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Blake Farenthold (R-Texas).

02.04.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) delivered the following remarks at today’s House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security hearing. The focus of the hearing was Smith’s Legal Workforce Act, which would expand the E-Verify program nationwide in an effort to discourage illegal immigration and ensure jobs are made available only to those authorized to legally work in the U.S. Congressman Smith: “Almost 20 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, 7 million people are working in the United States illegally. These jobs should go to American citizens and legal workers who need these jobs. “The Legal Workforce Act turns off the jobs magnet that attracts so many illegal immigrants to the United States. The bill expands the E-Verify system and applies it to all U.S. employers. “Illegal workers cost Americans jobs or depress their wages, according to nearly all studies on the subject. For example, a Center for Immigration Studies report found that illegal immigration reduces the wages of American workers by approximately $650 per worker. We need to do all we can to protect the jobs and wages of American workers. “The program is free, quick and easy to use. In fact, E-Verify will soon be available for use on smart phones; it takes about one minute per potential employee. Individuals provide their Social Security Number when they visit a doctor, open a bank account, or buy a home. It makes sense that other businesses should check the status of prospective employees to ensure they have a legal workforce.” E-Verify is a web-based program created in 1996 and operated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Today, nearly 575,000 American employers voluntarily use E-Verify. Smith’s full posted statement can be found here and a video of his remarks can be found here.
02.03.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) voted today to repeal the Presidents costly and ineffective government takeover of the health care sector. The Republican-led House of Representatives passed H.R. 596 by a vote of 239 – 186. Congressman Smith: “ObamaCare is one of President Obama’s many failed policies. In addition to being unpopular, Americans are reminded every day that ObamaCare is unaffordable and unworkable. “Millions of people have not only lost their doctor, but also have lost their previous health care plans - all while premiums increase. It’s time to put an end to this administration’s false promises and finally repeal this law. Americans deserve better.” A recent Politico poll found that only 18 percent of Americans believe their quality of care will get better with ObamaCare. And 57 percent believe that their costs will rise under ObamaCare, while only 7 percent believe ObamaCare will reduce their health care costs. Today’s bill not only repeals ObamaCare, but also instructs Committee Chairmen to work on better solutions to reform health care in America. The vote represents the 56th time the House of Representatives has voted to repeal the law in part or whole. Under new Republican leadership, the Senate is expected to have its first opportunity to vote on repeal.
02.02.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to the president’s FY2016 budget request. Congressman Smith: “The American people have spoken out time and again in favor of more efficient, effective, and accountable government. Our debt has grown by more than $7 trillion under this president and all Americans have to show for it is a bloated, overreaching bureaucracy and highly unpopular programs like ObamaCare. “The president’s latest budget would continue to ignore the wishes of the American people by drastically increasing spending, taxes, and our nation’s debt by more than ever before. And the president’s budget never balances. Texas families balance their own budgets, and they deserve the same from their government. “The president’s budget only works for Washington. In Congress, we will deliver a budget that balances and that works for the American people.” The president’s FY16 budget includes: Tax Increases • Despite $2.1 trillion in new tax increases, President Obama’s budget never balances—ever. • Major proposed tax increases include higher levies on savings and investment, small businesses, and increases in the costs of hiring workers. • These tax hikes would stunt the economic growth needed to get Americans back to work, and come on top of $1.7 trillion in tax hikes already imposed by this Administration. Spending Increases • The President’s budget increases annually-appropriated spending for next year by $74 billion relative to current law. In over 5 years, he would increase such spending by $322 billion. • Next year alone, the President’s budget would grow total federal spending by $259 billion, or 7 percent. • Total spending will increase by 65 percent ($2.4 trillion) in 10 years under the President’s plan. Interest Costs Skyrocket • President Obama’s plan more than triples interest costs, which remain the fastest growing item in the budget. • Interest on the debt this year would be $229 billion, but would rise to $785 billion in 2025 under his plan. • At the end of President’s plan, annual interest costs would be larger than his proposed spending for national defense, Medicaid or the combined total of all non-defense agency spending. Debt Climbs • Since 2009, we’ve added $7.5 trillion to the debt and spent $21.1 trillion. • The President’s budget plan would add $8.5 trillion to the debt. • Cumulative deficits would amount to $5.7 trillion, and gross debt would climb to $26.3 trillion in 2025.
01.30.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in advance of immigration enforcement legislation to be considered by the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman Smith: “Throughout my time in Congress, two of my top priorities have been enforcement of current immigration laws and securing our borders. This administration has failed to do either. “The new Congress has an opportunity to restore the rule of law that the president has repeatedly undermined. We must first defund the president’s unilateral and unconstitutional executive actions, and then we must take further steps to protect American workers. The House has taken the first step to defund the president’s unprecedented executive amnesty. And I am glad our Republican Senate leaders have pledged to bring this legislation up for a vote soon. This must remain a top legislative priority. “Next week, the House Judiciary Committee will also begin work on a number of other measures intended to strengthen the interior enforcement of current immigration laws. Much of this legislation, including The Legal Workforce Act, goes back to my time as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. “A bill that I will introduce ensures that employers use the tools available to comply with current laws to avoid hiring those here illegally. This is crucial legislation that puts American workers first and requires employers to use the E-Verify system to check the eligibility of potential employees. “This is the type of common-sense legislation the House should consider as soon as the Senate has followed our lead in defunding this president’s lawless executive actions.” On Wednesday, February 4 at 10:00 a.m., the Immigration Subcommittee will once more examine Smith’s Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 1772), which was passed by the House Judiciary Committee in the past two Congresses. This bill brings the I-9 system into the 21st century and discourages illegal immigration by ensuring jobs are only made available to those authorized to work in the U.S. Specifically, it requires employers to check the work eligibility of all future hires through the web-based E-Verify system. Smith served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from 2011-2012. He also founded and chairs the House Border Security Caucus.
01.29.2015	Washington, D.C. – Following news reports last week that as many as 50 data mining companies were provided direct access to monitor information entered on the HealthCare.gov website, Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent several letters seeking an explanation. Access to HealthCare.gov was apparently provided with permission and even encouragement from the federal government to companies who profit from gathering and selling personal information. “Every American who has visited the Obamacare website may have been monitored by numerous companies without their consent or knowledge,” Smith wrote. “This revelation raises serious questions about both personal privacy and cybersecurity on the HealthCare.gov website.” The Associated Press reported that when a person applies for coverage through HealthCare.gov, approximately 50 data mining companies immediately become aware of the individual’s online presence. Data mining companies can then search for sensitive personal information that applicants are required to enter. This can include a social security number, annual salary, employment, place of residence, immigration status, military service, criminal history, financial information, age, whether one is pregnant, whether one smokes and more. Smith wrote that “Once a data mining company seizes this treasure trove of sensitive personal information, it is able to combine this data with other information collected by tapping into commercial websites and databases such as phone calls, texts, social media posts, frequently visited websites, and credit card purchases. These detailed electronic records on millions of Americans could then be sold to other businesses, U.S. government agencies, foreign governments and even criminal enterprises that are willing to pay large sums of money for the information…” “It is astonishing that the Obama administration has allowed scores of these companies to take up permanent residence on the HealthCare.gov website.” The letters request information about how decisions were made, who was aware, and how the administration justifies these actions. Separate letters were sent to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy as well as the heads of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the 113th Congress, the Committee held several hearings on the security of HealthCare.gov, including a November, 2013 hearing, Is My Data on HealthCare.gov Secure?; a January 2014 hearing, Healthcare.gov: Consequences of Stolen Identity; and a March 2014 hearing, Can Technology Protect Americans from International Cybercriminals? Chairman Smith’s full letters can be found HERE. ###
01.22.2015	The House Dyslexia Caucus today announced its 114th Congress leadership with Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-Calif.) serving as bipartisan co-chairs. Congressman Smith: “I am pleased to co-chair this important caucus with my colleague, Congresswoman Brownley. As a member of this caucus and chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I have realized the importance of continued dyslexia research as well as the need for early detection and intervention in our schools. “My hope is that this caucus will continue to play a key role in educating our colleagues in Congress and the public about dyslexia. Changing the way we approach dyslexia—as possibility rather than disability—can enhance opportunities and brighten futures for millions.” Congresswoman Brownley: “I am delighted to welcome Congressman Smith, who has been a leader in Congress on this important issue, as Caucus Co-Chair. As the mother of a daughter with dyslexia, I understand all too well the challenges that these uniquely talented and gifted individuals face. By bringing together individuals with dyslexia, community advocates, scientists, educators, and policymakers, the Caucus can play an important role in raising awareness about dyslexia, which affects millions of Americans. I hope the Caucus can help ensure that dyslexia is better understood and earlier identified, so that students are provided the necessary resources and accommodations to reach their full potential.” Dyslexia is the most common learning disability in the United States, impacting Americans from all walks of life at all ages, including Members of Congress, their families, and thousands of their constituents. As many as one in five Americans struggle with dyslexia or other learning disorders. According to a November 2011 Government Accountability Office report (GAO-12-40), many students with learning and other disabilities, including dyslexia, are not receiving accommodations, such as extended testing time, required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when they take high stakes examinations such as the SAT, GRE, LSAT, or US Medical Licensing Examinations and others. The Dyslexia Caucus was founded as a bipartisan task force dedicated to increasing public awareness about dyslexia and ensuring equal educational opportunities to students with the disorder.
01.20.2015	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement on the evening of the president’s annual State of the Union address: Congressman Smith: “No one has suffered more than the middle class under President Obama’s policies. For six years the Obama Administration has pushed the same tax-and-spend policies, and for six years they haven’t worked. Family incomes have remained flat. “Our debt has grown by more than $7 trillion under this president and all Americans have to show for it is a bloated, overreaching bureaucracy and highly unpopular programs like ObamaCare. Last year alone, our federal government overspent by almost $500 billion – essentially bouncing a $1,500 check on behalf of every American. And now, the president wants to raise taxes to spend more of Americans’ hard-earned dollars. I don’t believe the majority of Americans are happy with the way the government has spent their money. And I don’t believe they want to raise taxes just so the president can spend more on programs like ObamaCare. “The president has also implemented policies that have punished hard-working Americans who are struggling to get ahead. When he took unilateral, unconstitutional executive actions on immigration this past fall, President Obama added 5 million illegal immigrants to the workforce to compete with unemployed and underemployed Americans. His actions actually give employers a $3,000 incentive to hire those who came here illegally, thanks to an ObamaCare provision. That is why the House recently passed legislation to put a stop to these damaging policies. “In the House, we have already taken action to lower the tax burden for everyone, reduce our deficit, and promote policies that protect American workers. We will continue our work on behalf of the American people.”
01.14.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in support of a House Homeland Security appropriations package that would defund the president’s recent executive amnesty actions and the deferred action policies responsible for an unprecedented surge of illegal immigration along the Southern border. Congressman Smith: “The president’s choice is clear: listen to the American people and their representatives or continue pursuing an extreme, unlawful agenda. This bill is a reasonable response to his unreasonable and unprecedented actions. These are the actions Congress must take to restore the rule of law and the American people’s trust in their representative government. “The American people want policies that protect public safety, support the American worker, and increase border security. The American people have spoken, and in the House, we are listening. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation and stand with us.” Smith, chair and founder of the House Border Security Caucus, advocated for passage of the House bill prior to Wednesday’s vote. In addition to the underlying appropriations language, Smith supported five Republican amendments. The bill will be sent as a single package to the Senate for a vote. Amendments Congressman Smith supported include: Amendment offered by Reps. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), and Lou Bartletta (R-Pa.): Prevents any funds to be used to carry-out the executive actions announced on November 20, 2014 to grant deferred action to an estimated four million unlawful immigrants. Defunds the Obama Administration’s so-called prosecutorial discretion memos that have gutted immigration enforcement within the United States. Prevents future attempts by the executive branch to fund any substantially similar future policies to those defunded. Makes clear that the defunded programs have no statutory or constitutional basis and therefore have no legal effect. Defunds the ability of aliens to receive any Federal benefits based on these policies. Amendment offered by Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.): Provides that no funds may be used to consider new, renewal or previously denied DACA applications. Amendment offered by Reps. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) and Martha Roby (R-Ala.): Requires U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to remove illegal immigrant sex offenders and domestic violence perpetrators. Amendment offered by Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.): Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services should stop putting the interests of unlawful immigrants ahead of legal immigrants. Under the President’s deferred action programs, legal immigrants playing by the rules and seeking to come to the United States the right way have paid the price for President Obama’s executive actions. They’ve faced longer wait times, even though they have paid the fees to have their applications processed. Amendment offered by Reps. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) and Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.): Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. workers should not be harmed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ actions. Under President Obama’s executive amnesty plan, in many cases businesses now have a $3,000 incentive to hire an unlawful immigrant over a legal worker, something Smith first raised concerns about last November. Under the Affordable Care Act, many businesses face a $3,000-per-employee penalty if they do not provide health care to their workers. Since unlawful immigrants are not eligible for Obamacare, they will now be more attractive to hire than American workers in many instances.
01.13.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today applauded House passage of H.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability Act. Smith first introduced the bill in 2011 during his tenure as House Judiciary Committee chairman and was a lead sponsor when the House passed it in the 113th Congress. Congressman Smith: “This White House has repeatedly bypassed Congress and the American people to pursue its extreme and aggressive regulatory agenda. The fact that the same White House is threatening to veto the Regulatory Accountability Act tells me we must be doing something right. “We have been working to rein in overreaching regulations and pass this common-sense legislation since my time as House Judiciary Committee Chairman in 2011. I applaud its passage today and hope that the Senate will swiftly pass it as well.” The White House has issued a veto threat against the bill, which would hold federal agencies accountable for implementing laws in the least burdensome and least costly manner for the taxpayer. Americans currently face more than $3 trillion from federal taxation and regulation, or approximately thirty percent of the average American household income in 2013. The legislation would: Require agencies to choose the lowest cost rulemaking alternative that meets statutory objectives. Improve public outreach and agency fact-finding to identify better, more efficient regulatory alternatives. Require agencies to use the best reasonably obtainable science. Provide on-the-record but streamlined administrative hearings in the highest-impact rulemakings—those that impose $1 billion or more in annual costs—so interested parties can subject critical evidence to cross-examination. Require advance notice of proposed major rulemakings to increase public input before costly agency positions are proposed and entrenched. Strengthen judicial review of new agency regulations to make sure the federal courts can enforce these requirements.
01.12.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined fifteen Texas Republican colleagues in support of legislation the House plans to vote on this week to fight against President Obama’s unconstitutional executive immigration actions. Congressman Smith: “Texans – and the majority of Americans – have cried out against the president’s unilateral and unconstitutional immigration actions this past November. They are not interested in this president’s extreme agenda. They want policies that protect public safety, support the American worker, increase border security, and uphold our rule of law. “That is why I support legislation the House plans to vote on this week. It would both defund the unconstitutional immigration actions the president took last November and many of the president’s policies that provoked the deadly surge at our Southern border last summer. I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to join us in strong support of this legislation.” Members joining Smith in a statement of support include: Congressman Brian Babin, Congressman Kevin Brady, Congressman John Carter, Congressman Blake Farenthold, Congressman Bill Flores, Congressman Jeb Hensarling, Congressman William Hurd, Congressman Sam Johnson, Congressman Michael McCaul, Congressman Randy Neugebauer, Congressman Pete Olson, Congressman Ted Poe, Congressman John Ratcliffe, Congressman Pete Sessions, and Congressman Mac Thornberry. It reads as follows: “As members of the Texas delegation, we will continue to stand firmly against any action that erodes our constitutional values, degrades our nation’s rule of law, and circumvents the legislative process. Since the President announced his amnesty plan, we have been vigorously fighting against his unconstitutional actions and have been working together to find effective solutions to win this battle. “Last December House Republicans vowed to take up legislation in the second week of the 114th Congress to fight the President’s illegal executive fiat. Today the Republicans of the Texas Delegation join together in support of legislation that is scheduled to be considered by the House this week that stops the President’s amnesty plan and reflects our conservative values. This legislation would prevent the President from enforcing his executive amnesty plan by barring any funds from being used to carry out his executive actions or any other related illegal executive action that he might take in the future. While we recognize the value that legal immigrants bring to our nation and the economy, we must ensure that our laws are followed. We support this legislation because it enforces the law, secures our border, and reinforces the oath that we have taken as legislators to preserve and protect the Constitution. “As Members of Congress, we have the responsibility to effectively work within the constraints of the Constitution and the limits of the law. As members of the Texas delegation, we have the responsibility to act in the best interest of the people of Texas. This week we will uphold both of those responsibilities by preserving our nation’s rule of law, fighting for the people of Texas, and combating the President’s unconstitutional, unilateral actions.”
01.12.2015	U.S. Representatives Lamar Smith (R-TX21), Joaquin Castro (D-TX20), Will Hurd (R-TX23), Henry Cuellar (D-TX28) and Lloyd Doggett (D-TX35), released the following statement after introducing a resolution honoring the San Antonio Spurs for winning the 2014 NBA League National Championship: "The Spurs are champions because of their strong commitment to personal excellence and understanding of the power of teamwork. Their willingness to give back to our community makes them even more worthy of being honored. We're proud to have them as our hometown team and confident we'll get to cheer them all the way to the top again this year!" Congressman Smith with San Antonio City Manager Sheryl Sculley and Mayor Ivy Taylor. The 2014 NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs.
01.09.2015	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in favor of a proposal to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Chairman Smith: “The president is out of excuses and out of touch with the American people in his opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. After six long years of thorough review – including hearings held by the House Science Committee – we know that this pipeline will enhance our energy independence with minimal impact to the environment. I applaud the Republican-led Senate for bringing this legislation to the floor for a vote in the face of President Obama’s veto threat.” On Friday, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled in favor of the governor’s approval of Keystone XL, removing the last legal obstacle standing in the way of the pipeline. Under new Republican leadership, the Senate is expected to pass a similar bill that could be sent to the president as early as next week. The bill would clear the way for building of the 875-mile Keystone XL pipeline. The Science Committee’s Energy and Environment Subcommittees held a joint hearing in May 2013 to examine the safety and environmental features of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Following that hearing, Smith sent a letter urging the State Department to “rely upon sound science informed by its own extensive record and analysis, and prevent political intervention from influencing its decision.” Despite claims from those who oppose the project, the State Department has stated that the proposed pipeline would “have a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline” and concluded it would have minimal impact to resources along the proposed route. Additionally, the Department estimated that construction of the pipeline would support over 40,000 jobs. The pipeline would deliver up to 830,000 barrels per day of Canadian oil sands and Bakken crude from North Dakota to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. ###
01.08.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) this week introduced one of his first bills of the 114th Congress, the Repeal Executive Amnesty Act of 2015, alongside Congressman Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) and Congressman Lou Barletta (R-Penn.). Smith previously served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and is the founder of the House Border Security Caucus. Congressman Smith: “The president’s unilateral, unconstitutional immigration actions last fall were extreme and unprecedented. But they were certainly not the only amnesty actions he has taken. Previous actions invited the deadly surge at our Southern border this summer. We must restore the rule of law and right the wrongs this president has inflicted on the American people and our immigration system. His actions cannot go unanswered. “The bill I have introduced with Congressman Aderholt and Congressman Barletta is a reasonable response to the extreme actions the president has taken to undermine and rewrite our immigration laws and weaken border security. It defunds the president’s unconstitutional actions this past November that gave amnesty and work permits to 5 million people who came here illegally. It would ensure those who came here illegally do not receive government benefits. And it would restore the Secure Communities program law enforcement officials have used to successfully remove hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant criminals.” The Repeal Executive Amnesty Act of 2015 would: Defund President Obama’s executive amnesty, including the memoranda issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Prohibit DHS or any other federal agency from using funds or fees made available to them to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out any amnesty policies established through executive memos. Among other things, it would cut off funding for the president's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals amnesty and the broader executive amnesty program announced on Nov. 20, 2014. Bar illegal immigrants granted deferred action or parole by the Obama administration from accessing certain public benefits including Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare. Prevent illegal immigrants who are granted deferred action from gaining work authorization. The bill would protect American workers by preventing millions of illegal immigrants from legally taking jobs sought by citizens and legal immigrants. Reinstate the Secure Communities program terminated by DHS Sec. Jeh Johnson on Nov. 20, 2014. Secure Communities has been used to remove more than 375,000 convicted criminal aliens. The bill requires DHS to assume custody and initiate removal proceedings against aliens identified under Secure Communities. Restore state and local governments as partners in immigration enforcement by expressly reaffirming that local law enforcement, acting within constitutional limits, has the authority to identify, apprehend, and detain individuals suspected of violating U.S. immigration laws. In addition, the bill requires federal authorities to take custody of removable aliens at the request of state or local authorities. Curb the abuse of parole that has allowed entire classes of inadmissible aliens to enter or remain in the United States. The bill restores the original intent of parole authority, that it be used on a limited, case-by-case basis to allow immigrants to enter the U.S. temporarily for humanitarian purposes. End the incentives for smuggling minors into the United States by amending the 2008 William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act to treat aliens from non-contiguous countries the same way the law treats Mexican and Canadian minors who enter the country illegally.
01.06.2015	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in recognition of the beginning of the 114th Congress. Congressman Smith: “In the 114th Congress, House Republicans have the largest majority that we’ve seen in the last 65 years, and Harry Reid’s rule in the Senate has come to an end. “I remain committed to my constituents’ priorities: defunding the President’s unconstitutional executive amnesty, repealing ObamaCare, reining in the EPA, and moving forward with construction of the Keystone pipeline. Now is the time for conservatives to stand united in our fight against this overreaching presidency. Our work has just begun.” Smith continues to lead the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee as one of six Texas Republican Committee chairs in the 114th Congress. As part of the first day’s agenda, Smith voted in favor of the “Hire More Heroes Act of 2015,” a jobs bill that would encourage small businesses to hire veterans by exempting them from the employee limit under ObamaCare. A rules package passed today also included language that would give specific deposition authority to the House Science Committee – something that has been granted to a select few committees in previous Congresses. The authority was granted in order to allow the Committee to continue to pursue its aggressive agenda reining in executive branch overreach at agencies such as the EPA. Under the Obama Administration, the EPA has rammed through multiple controversial rules that will cost consumers and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. Chairman Smith has repeatedly criticized the agency’s “abusive regulatory agenda” and introduced Science Committee legislation that would increase transparency and accountability at the EPA and prohibit the agency from using non-public, “secret science” to justify the costly rules. That legislation passed the House in November 2014. The House and Senate are also expected to vote later this week on a proposal that would move forward with the Keystone XL pipeline.
12.17.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to President Obama’s announced policy changes regarding the U.S. and Cuba. Congressman Smith: “Alan Gross should never have been held prisoner by Cuba. I’m disappointed by the president’s announcement today. This continues a troubling trend of misguided foreign policy that does not make Americans safer, and that undermines our core values as an open and free democracy. The president’s policy rewards a dictator who has deprived the people of Cuba of their freedoms.”
12.11.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after voting against passage of a $1 trillion omnibus appropriations bill. Congressman Smith: “Like many of my colleagues, I would have preferred a bill that reduces spending, blocks the president’s unconstitutional executive orders granting amnesty, and increases border security. “Unfortunately, the bill before the House today did not meet these criteria and therefore I could not support it. “In the last election, the American people rejected the policies of this administration and the Democratic lock-down in the Senate. I look forward to the new Congress when we will be able to work on legislation that expands our economy, gets rid of the red tape that burdens American families, and secures our borders. I will continue working to put a stop to the president’s amnesty that punishes American workers and undermines our rule of law.” ###
12.05.2014	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released a statement following the launch of the Orion spacecraft from Cape Canaveral: Chairman Smith: “The Orion launch is a major milestone for U.S. space exploration and our efforts to travel further into our solar system than ever before. That is why I place the highest priority on ensuring NASA remains on budget and on schedule with the Space Launch System (SLS). “I’m extremely committed to the success of NASA’s Orion vehicle and SLS. The Science Committee will once more review the progress of these crucial systems at a hearing next week as part of ongoing oversight responsibilities.”
12.04.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after voting in support of H.R. 5759, Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The president’s unilateral, unconstitutional executive actions granting amnesty to five million illegal immigrants cannot go unanswered. Today’s vote represents the House’s condemnation of these actions. I urge Senate Majority Leader Reid to put aside his political considerations so that the legislative branch can respond in a unified way to the president’s blatant misuse of his executive authority. “This is just the beginning of our commitment to restore the rule of law for all Americans. I remain committed to stopping these egregious actions from going into effect.�?
12.03.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released a statement of support today after Texas Attorney General and Governor-elect, Greg Abbott filed a suit in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas that challenges President Obama’s recent immigration executive orders. Congressman Smith: “The president’s unilateral, unconstitutional actions have real, negative impacts on Americans living in states like Texas. I commend Governor-elect Abbott and each of the 17 states bringing suit. They are taking serious steps to address the president’s serious misuse of executive branch authority. I also agree that the president’s actions will only serve to “exacerbate the humanitarian crisis along the southern border.” “The Constitution is not a technicality. It is the document that has preserved our freedoms for more than two centuries. In Congress, I remain committed to doing whatever is necessary to put a stop to these actions and restore our nation’s rule of law.” The 17 states bringing the suit include: Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
12.03.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after voting in support of a package of tax measures, H.R. 5771, the Tax Increase Prevention Act, that will prevent $45 Billion in tax increases from going into effect for the 2014 tax season. The package will mean relief for every one in six taxpayers. Congressman Smith: “As the steward of taxpayer dollars, Congress should always seek to return as much as possible to taxpayers’ pockets. This package will allow residents in states like Texas to deduct state and local sales taxes on their federal returns. It will allow teachers to be reimbursed for expenses in their classrooms and encourage private sector industry to continue making crucial investments in research and development. These are common-sense measures that we will revisit in the next Congress when we address more permanent tax reform and simplification.”
12.03.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith, chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, today held a hearing to examine misuse of taxpayer dollars by the National Ecological Observatory Network Inc. (NEON), an environmental non-profit funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The group exploited lax NSF oversight to spend taxpayer dollars on unallowable expenses such as a $25,000 Christmas party, $1000 a month for premium coffee service, $112,000 for professional lobbying, as well as liquor for office happy hours and trips to a high-end resort in France. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “Federal agencies must be held accountable for their waste and misuse of taxpayer funds. And the NSF needs to be held accountable for how they spend taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. The basic responsibility of any government agency is to act in the national interest. The NSF needs to meet that standard.” The NSF entered into a long-term agreement with NEON to develop and operate the project’s national network of fixed and mobile sensors. An audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) identified more than $150 million in unsupported or questionable costs in the NEON proposal. It concluded that there was not a “fair and reasonable basis” for NSF to enter into a contract. Nevertheless, NSF did not wait for the audit results. It instead finalized an agreement based on NEON’s original cost proposal. Committee members questioned how the NSF managed to approve, without any change, a $433 million proposed construction budget for which the DCAA auditors found $150 million was unsupported or questionable. The NSF’s Inspector General testified that unallowable costs formed the basis for two fraud referrals that were ultimately sent to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) for possible prosecution. But the DOJ declined to accept the case. Audits have also raised questions about cost proposals that were accepted by NSF for several major projects. These include the Ocean Observatories Initiative, the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope, NEON and, currently, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.
12.01.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today submitted hundreds of pages of comments to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy, urging the agency to scrap its costly rule to regulate emissions from existing electric power plants in the U.S. Today is the deadline to submit formal comments on the proposal. Chairman Smith: “This proposal is outrageous. Congress has not given the EPA the authority to re-write laws or discover new powers for the sake of expediency. This proposal mocks our constitutional framework and subverts the rule of law. We have already spent too much time on a bad idea. Scrap this proposal and come up with something workable.” The goal of the comments is to provide the EPA with critical information obtained by the Committee in exercising its jurisdictional responsibilities. Over the past few months, the Committee has held several hearings focused on the technical and scientific issues underpinning this proposal. All regulations must have a sound scientific basis. The Science Committee’s comments highlight questions related to the technical, scientific and policy underpinnings of the proposal. Chairman Smith’s letter states that until these deficiencies are addressed and adequate peer review is undertaken, the EPA stands in default. The copy of Chairman Smith’s cover letter to the formal comments can be found here.
11.21.2014	Washington, D.C. – House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement congratulating students chosen from around the country to participate in the 2014-2015 NASA Student Launch Challenge: Chairman Smith: “Congratulations to the students chosen to participate in this competition. NASA’s education and public outreach is an important element of STEM education. These are the students we must inspire to pursue STEM careers so they can help us blaze the trail to the next frontier. NASA has selected eight teams from middle and high schools across the country to participate in the 2014-2015 NASA Student Launch Challenge, April 7-12, organized by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Student Launch Challenge engages students in a research-based, experiential exploration activity. Teams participating in the challenge must design, build and launch a reusable rocket, with a scientific or engineering payload, capable of reaching an altitude of one mile. The 2014-2015 middle and high school teams who will compete are: Durham Area Rocketry, Durham, North Carolina Krueger Middle School, San Antonio, Texas Madison West High School (Land Imaging), Madison, Wisconsin Madison West High School (Muons), Madison, Wisconsin Plantation High School, Plantation, Florida Spring Grove High School, Spring Grove, Pennsylvania St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, Akron, Ohio Victory Christian Center School, Charlotte, North Carolina NASA Student Launch is open to middle and high school students, and university and college students. The program is intended to advance education in science, technology, engineering and math and expose students to careers in aeronautics and aerospace. ###
11.21.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in further response to immigration executive actions President Obama signed today: Congressman Smith: “The president wants to rewrite our immigration laws and give amnesty and work permits to millions of illegal immigrants. These actions put millions of illegal immigrants ahead of Americans and those who followed the rules in order to live in the United States lawfully. But the president also eliminated a highly successful program that takes criminal illegal immigrants off our streets and assists in removing them from the country. “The Secure Communities program was put in place in 2008 as a partnership between local law enforcement and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Despite a lack of support from this administration, the program has been used to remove almost 400,000 convicted criminal aliens. Local officials, many in my home state of Texas, have used the Secure Communities program to protect Americans and keep our communities safe. Those identified under the program are often repeat offenders and have committed crimes such as theft, assault, drunk and drugged driving, and even murder. “The president cannot claim that he will prioritize deportation of felons while scrapping a successful program designed to do just that.” The Secure Communities program uses an already-existing federal-information sharing partnership between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that helps to identify criminal aliens so that ICE can take enforcement action. To date, over 375,000 convicted criminal aliens have been removed as a result of Secure Communities. A White House memo released Thursday stated that the president’s actions would do away with the program but claims it would replace with a new ‘Priority Enforcement Program.’ Few details have been made available regarding and how it would differ from Secure Communities.
11.21.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement today after the White House announced that President Obama will provide legal status and work permits to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants: Congressman Smith: “The president knows that his executive amnesty is not what the American people want, and it is not what Congress wants. That is why he delayed making this announcement until after this November’s election. “President Obama has put the interests of an extreme wing of his party above the interests of American workers. Some have said that the actions he is taking this week equal a declaration of war on Republicans. I believe he is actually declaring war on the American people and our democracy. “As elected representatives of the American people, my colleagues and I intend to listen to our constituents in the coming weeks. We must restore the rule of law and the people’s faith in their democratic republic once more.”
11.19.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement today after the White House announced that President Obama will provide legal status and work permits to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants later this week: Congressman Smith: “The president is threatening amnesty by executive order, which he has said repeatedly he doesn’t have authority to do. “A strong majority of the American people oppose amnesty by executive order and so does Congress. They also oppose actions that would threaten American workers and weaken our borders. “The actions President Obama is planning would be unprecedented and contrary to his oath of office to enforce the nation’s laws.” A recent survey by The Polling Company found that three-quarters of voters want the president to work with Congress to change immigration policies, not act on his own.
11.14.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to a State Department announcement that could open the door for millions to come to the U.S. from Central American countries. Congressman Smith: "The American people just suffered through an unprecedented border-surge as a result of the president's policies. Despite the fact that many who came from these same Central American countries should have been sent home, they are now being told to invite family to join them. "The president cannot continue to claim he cares about border security when he only has an appetite for border sabotage." In addition to those who came as part of the recent border surge, today's announcement would apply to a much larger number of lawful permanent residents, those with temporary protected status, parole, withholding of removal, deferred action, and deferred enforced departure. Those who qualify under the broad Obama administration terms and have a spouse or children under 21 in Honduras, Guatemala, or El Salvador could petition for those family members to be considered for in-country refugee processing or parole in the United States.
11.14.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in favor of a proposal to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Chairman Smith: “The president is the only one standing in the way of the Keystone XL pipeline and 40,000 new energy jobs. After six long years of thorough review – including hearings held by the House Science Committee – we know that this pipeline will enhance our energy independence with minimal impact to the environment. I urge the Senate to finally bring this legislation to the floor for a vote. If the president is listening to the American people, he will quickly approve the Keystone pipeline.” The Senate is expected to pass a similar bill that could be sent to the president as early as next week. The bill would clear the way for building of the 875-mile Keystone XL pipeline. The Science Committee’s Energy and Environment Subcommittees held a joint hearing in May 2013 to examine the safety and environmental features of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Following that hearing, Smith sent a letter urging the State Department to “rely upon sound science informed by its own extensive record and analysis, and prevent political intervention from influencing its decision.” Despite claims from those who oppose the project, the State Department has stated that the proposed pipeline would “have a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline” and concluded it would have minimal impact to resources along the proposed route. Additionally, the Department estimated that construction of the pipeline would support over 40,000 jobs. The pipeline would deliver up to 830,000 barrels per day of Canadian oil sands and Bakken crude from North Dakota to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast.
11.13.2014	WASHINGTON – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to news reports of President Obama’s plans to enact immigration measures by executive order: Congressman Smith: “This executive order would be a violation of the president’s oath of office and a blatant abuse of power. The president has sworn an oath of office to uphold the law but now he is planning to re-write them on his own. The Constitution specifically gives Congress – not the president – the power to make immigration laws. The president himself has repeatedly said he does not have the power to re-write immigration laws. “These actions would be a direct hit on American workers and their families. Many Americans are underemployed and are struggling to find full-time, good-paying jobs. By giving work permits to millions of illegal immigrants, the president would put them above the needs of millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans.” On March 28, 2011, President Obama said, “With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed . . . . [F]or me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform to my appropriate role as President.” On July 25, 2011, President Obama stated, “I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books . . . . I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) laws on my own . . . . But that’s not how – that’s not how our system works. That’s not how our democracy functions. That’s not how our Constitution is written.” On September 28, 2011, during a White House forum on Hispanic issues, President Obama claimed, “[T]his notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true . . . . But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce . . . . [T]he notion that somehow, by myself, I can go and do these things. It’s just not true.” On November 25, 2013, President Obama responded to individuals who called on him to stop deportations of illegal immigrants by saying, “[I]f, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we’re also a nation of laws.” ### Congressman Smith represents the 21st District of Texas. He was named the most effective lawmaker in the 112th Congress when he served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He also serves on the Committee on Homeland Security and as chairman of the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee.
11.12.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today congratulated two health facilities in Texas’s 21st Congressional District that are being recognized with the 2014 Malcom Baldrige National Quality Award. Hill Country Memorial in Fredericksburg, Texas and St. David’s HealthCare in Austin, Texas are receiving the award, which is the nation’s highest Presidential honor for performance excellence through innovation, improvement and visionary leadership. Congressman Smith: “Congratulations to Hill Country Memorial and St. David’s HealthCare on receiving this high honor. The facts speak for themselves: two out of four of this year’s award winners hail from Central Texas. Their records of excellence and community service make them among the top health care providers in the nation.” Two other awardees were named today: PricewaterhouseCoopers Public Sector Practice in McLean, Virginia received an award for service, and Elevations Credit Union in Boulder, Colorado was recognized as a nonprofit organization. An independent board of examiners recommended this year’s Baldrige Award recipients from a field of 22 applicants after evaluating them in seven areas: leadership; strategic planning; customer focus; measurement, analysis and knowledge management; workforce focus; operations focus; and results. The Baldrige Award was established by Congress in 1987 as a program within the Commerce Department’s National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST). The 2014 Baldrige Award will be presented at an April 2015 ceremony during the Quest for Excellence conference in Baltimore, Maryland.
11.12.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after President Obama announced a climate deal with China. Chairman Smith: “President Obama negotiated a deal to tie our economy’s hands while driving up energy costs for hardworking American families. I fail to see how this agreement benefits the United States. China has not promised to do anything other than increase its own energy production at unprecedented rates. Why would the president boast about an agreement where the American people come up with the short end of the stick?”
11.11.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in honor of our nation’s observance of Veterans Day: Congressman Smith: “Today we honor all the veterans, past and present, who have served our country and defended our nation’s freedoms. America is a stronger country today because of the sacrifices our veterans have made. The debt that we owe our brave servicemen and women can never fully be repaid. Our commitment to our veterans is not something to remember only one day a year, but a commitment which lasts a lifetime.” Congressman Smith recently voted for Veterans Affairs legislation that passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by the president. That legislation would expand access to care for veterans, expedite the firing of negligent VA employees, provide for additional medical staff, and lease facilities for 27 new VA hospitals and clinics. In addition, Congressman Smith’s office can assist veterans in the 21st Congressional district seeking assistance with questions or concerns regarding veterans' benefits.

11.10.2014	Recent news reports have indicated that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) appears to have deleted thousands of text messages sent and received by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on her official agency phone, including those that would qualify as federal records under the law. Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to EPA Inspector General Arthur A. Elkins, Jr. requesting a review of EPA’s records management policies. Chairman Smith: “Despite promises to create an ‘unprecedented level of openness in government,’ this administration routinely withholds information from the public. Particularly at the EPA, there appears to be a pattern of behavior directed at subverting transparency and accountability. Federal guidelines are clear that all messages sent between agency heads and their colleagues must be preserved. Why delete thousands of text messages unless you have something to hide? Americans deserve transparency from their government officials. Administrator McCarthy should either stop deleting text messages, or stop texting.” While EPA has formally notified the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) about the potential loss of federal records from the deleted text messages, an EPA spokeswoman was quoted as saying, “Despite the filing…the agency maintains that the text messages neither had to be preserved nor were subject to disclosure. Text messages can legally be deleted.” Chairman Smith’s letter requests that the IG conduct a review of EPA’s compliance with its records management policies in order to “better evaluate the impact of EPA’s deleted text messages on the preservation of federal records, the ability of the public to access government information and Congress’ ability to conduct proper oversight.” The letter also highlights the fact that Administrator McCarthy is not the first senior-level administration employee to face questions about lost or deleted federal records. She is accompanied by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, and former Internal Revenue Service Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner. The full letter can be found here.
11.10.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) requesting detailed information and documents surrounding the agency’s decision to fund a grant that targeted political messages on social media. The web service, named “Truthy,” was used to target political commentary associated with words such as “Tea Party,” “GOP” and “conservative.” Chairman Smith: “The Committee and taxpayers deserve to know how NSF decided to award a large grant for a project that proposed to develop standards for online political speech and to apply those standards through development of a website that targeted conservative political comments. While some have argued that Truthy could be used to better understand things like disaster communication or to assist law enforcement, instead it appears Truthy focused on examples of ‘false and misleading ideas, hate speech, and subversive propaganda’ communicated by conservative groups. “Whether by amazing coincidence or on purpose, it appears that several social media accounts highlighted by Truthy were subsequently terminated by the owners of the social media platforms, effectively muzzling the political free speech of the targeted individuals and groups. In presenting and publishing the findings of their work, the Truthy research team proudly described how the web service targeted conservative social media messages. Their presentations featured examples of what they found to be online political speech ‘abuses’ by supporters of these groups.” Chairman Smith’s letter requests all documents and information about the grant proposal and all records and documents surrounding the NSF’s decision to approve the $919,917.00 grant in July, 2011. The full letter can be found here.
11.02.2014	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in response to today’s climate change report released by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Chairman Smith: “While I appreciate efforts to better understand the complex science of our ever-changing planet, the U.N. report says nothing new. Similar to previous reports, the latest findings appear more political than scientific. People are tired of the re-packaged rhetoric. It’s time to stop fear mongering and focus on an honest dialogue about real options. “It also appears that the U.N. is once more attempting to provide cover for costly new regulations and energy rationing. Yet the EPA has admitted that electricity regulations will have no discernible impact on the global temperature. America cannot afford to drive its economy over a cliff with the hopes that the rest of the world will make the same mistake.” This week, the IPCC met to approve the Synthesis Report of its fifth Assessment Report. The Synthesis Report combines previous reports the IPCC has already released and material contained in Special Reports produced during the 5th Assessment Cycle.
10.31.2014	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Space Subcommittee Chairman Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.) released the following statement in response to Friday’s news of a test flight anomaly involving Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo: Chairman Smith and Palazzo: “We are deeply saddened to hear of the loss of one of the test pilots during today’s SpaceShipTwo flight. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Virgin Galactic family.”
10.28.2014	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Space Subcommittee Chairman Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.) released the following statement in response to Tuesday's failed launch attempt at a Wallops Island,Virginia launch facility. Chairman Smith and Palazzo: “We add our disappointment to the thousands in the space community who worked tirelessly in support of Tuesday evening's launch attempt at Wallops Island. We are relieved to hear there are no reported fatalities, and we anticipate learning more about the circumstances surrounding the launch failure in the near future." Tuesday's launch was intended to carry a Cygnus spacecraft into orbit to dock with and deliver supplies to the International Space Station. The Antares rocket carrying the craft appeared to explode just moments after liftoff.
10.28.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) this week issued a subpoena to former U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, a top Assistant to President Obama during the launch of Healthcare.gov last November. The subpoena compels Mr. Park’s appearance before the Subcommittee on Oversight to answer questions regarding his role in developing and evaluating the operations and security of Healthcare.gov. Chairman Smith: “The Obama administration has failed to provide this Committee with information about the security of the Obamacare website. What is the White House trying to hide? News reports in July revealed that a hacker successfully breached the Obamacare website. And we don’t know how many other security breaches have gone unreported. The American people deserve to know their personal information on HealthCare.gov is absolutely secure. That is why I issued a subpoena to compel Mr. Park to testify under oath about his role in the website’s development.” Emails obtained by the Committee show that Mr. Park may have misled Congress and had more knowledge of the website’s development than he represented in testimony last November before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (OGR). Mr. Park testified that he didn’t have “detailed knowledge” of the website before it was launched, and said that he was “not even familiar with the development and testing regimen that happened prior to October 1.” Released today, the interim Majority Staff Report includes a timeline of events and emails obtained by the Committee that raise further questions about Mr. Park’s role and knowledge of security issues prior to October 1, 2013. Mr. Park, who recently stepped down as Chief Technology Officer, was the co-chair of the White House’s Affordable Care Act Information Technology Exchanges Steering Committee, a body responsible for overseeing security protocols during development of the Healthcare.gov website. After refusing to testify on five different occasions, Mr. Park scheduled a briefing for members of the Oversight Subcommittee on Wednesday September 10, 2014, regarding his management and oversight of the HealthCare.gov website, including security protocols. However, less than 24 hours in advance, the White House cancelled the briefing because it did not want any official transcript of the discussion. The subpoena requires Mr. Park to appear before the Science Committee’s Oversight Subcommittee to provide testimony under oath on Wednesday, November 19. A previous subpoena for documents was issued that required the White House to provide documents and emails pertaining to Mr. Park’s role in development of the website. The Science Committee held two hearings since the website’s botched launch and heard from leading security experts, including David Kennedy, a “white hat hacker,” who warned that Americans’ personal and financial information remains vulnerable to hackers and cyber criminals.
10.24.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today after being briefed on Ebola response team efforts at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston: Congressman Smith: “Fort Sam has the resources, expertise, and desire to help train the Ebola response team. I appreciate Major General Simeon Trombitas and Brigadier General Barbara Holcomb for giving me this timely briefing. Although we hope this team’s services will never be needed, it is clear that they will be trained and prepared to deploy anywhere needed by next week.”
10.21.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after media reports highlighted a one million dollar research project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2011 to analyze political messages and discussion on Twitter. The goal of the project is to analyze and detect ‘subversive propaganda’ in order to mitigate ‘misleading ideas’ on social media. Chairman Smith: “The government has no business using taxpayer dollars to support limiting free speech on Twitter and other social media. While the Science Committee has recently looked into a number of other questionable NSF grants, this one appears to be worse than a simple misuse of public funds. The NSF is out of touch and out of control. The Science Committee is investigating how this grant came to be awarded taxpayer dollars. The NSF must be held accountable for its funding decisions.” ICYMI: Additional Media Coverage: Washington Post: The government wants to study ‘social pollution’ on Twitter By Ajit Pai October 17, 2014 - Ajit Pai is a member of the Federal Communications Commission. If you take to Twitter to express your views on a hot-button issue, does the government have an interest in deciding whether you are spreading “misinformation’’? If you tweet your support for a candidate in the November elections, should taxpayer money be used to monitor your speech and evaluate your “partisanship’’? My guess is that most Americans would answer those questions with a resounding no. But the federal government seems to disagree. The National Science Foundation , a federal agency whose mission is to “promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and to secure the national defense,” is funding a project to collect and analyze your Twitter data. The project is being developed by researchers at Indiana University, and its purported aim is to detect what they deem “social pollution” and to study what they call “social epidemics,” including how memes — ideas that spread throughout pop culture — propagate. What types of social pollution are they targeting? “Political smears,” so-called “astroturfing” and other forms of “misinformation.” READ MORE Fox News: '1984' in 2014?

10.20.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was recently identified as the most effective lawmaker in the 112th Congress, according to a study conducted by political scientists at the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University. Researchers assigned lawmakers “Legislative Effectiveness Scores” using an equation to measure the member’s ability to push bills “through the legislative process and into law.” According to the scores, Smith rated as the highest lawmaker out of 449 congressional representatives that were scored in the 112th Congress. The study weighed factors such as legislators’ seniority, the number of bills authored that became law, and the relative substance and weight of bills authored. The results were recently unveiled in a website, www.thelawmakers.org, and accompanying book, “Legislative Effectiveness in the United States Congress: The Lawmakers.”
10.19.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today following the announcement that the Pentagon will train an Ebola response team at Fort Sam Houston in Smith’s congressional district in San Antonio. Congressman Smith: "Given its reputation as a premier Army medical training facility, I can think of no better place to assemble this team than Fort Sam Houston. I also hope that this administration will finally place a travel ban on African countries most affected by the Ebola virus. This is truly a case where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Fort Sam Houston has been called the “Home of Army Medicine” and is one of the largest military medical training facilities in the world. A recent Washington Post- ABC News poll showed that 91 percent of Americans support stricter screening of people entering the United States who have been in African countries affected by the outbreak, and 67 percent support completely restricting entry to people traveling from those countries. Smith has repeatedly called for a travel ban to be put in place after a Liberian man was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas in early October.
10.17.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to an announcement that the Texas Department of State Health Services is enacting its own travel ban on health workers who have treated Ebola patients. The decision comes as the Obama administration continues to refuse to enforce a flight ban on travelers coming from countries most affected by the Ebola virus. Smith has been calling for increased scrutiny on travel since early October when the first U.S. case of Ebola was confirmed in Dallas. Congressman Smith: “In the wake of this administration’s failures, I welcome today’s decision by the Texas Department of State Health Services to enact its own travel ban on health workers who have treated Ebola patients. Once more, the state of Texas has succeeded where the federal government failed. I believe this is truly a case where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It is time for the president to take common-sense measures, and past time to institute a travel ban on those coming from the countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. We should also immediately cease issuing the hundreds of visas that are being given out daily at our embassies in these three countries. “It is appropriate to allow our military forces to take the lead transporting personnel in and out of the West African countries as they assist in battling this deadly virus. The White House has given many empty excuses for not issuing a travel ban. By refusing to institute a ban on grounds that some might try to violate it, the president is admitting defeat from the start. We cannot abdicate our responsibility to protect the American public simply because the task appears difficult. “We will continue to keep all those working to fight this deadly virus in our thoughts and prayers. Our first priority must continue to be the safety and well-being of the American public.” A recent Washington Post- ABC News poll showed that 91 percent of Americans support stricter screening of people entering the United States who have been in African countries affected by the outbreak, and 67 percent support completely restricting entry to people traveling from those countries. On Thursday, Smith joined fellow Texas Republicans in a letter to President Obama formally asking that a travel ban be put in place for those traveling from West African countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak. Smith first called for officials to “review our policies for travel to and from the countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak” after a Liberian man was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas in early October.
10.16.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined fellow Texas Republicans in sending a letter to President Obama asking that he put a travel ban in place for those traveling from West African countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak. In part, the letter reads: “Second guessing will not protect Texans and other Americans who are worried about the spread of Ebola in the United States. Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act gives you the authority to deny entry into the United States of any class of aliens whose entry 'would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.' We strongly urge you to use that authority to put in place a travel ban for individuals traveling from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. As you know, these countries have been struggling to contain the Ebola outbreak. According to the World Health Organization, the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the largest and deadliest in recorded history and has killed more than 4,000 people. It is time to take proactive precautions to prevent additional Ebola cases from arriving on our shores. “Northeastern University Professor Alessandro Vespignani has developed a computer model that calculates the risk of Ebola being spread through air travel. According to his analysis, the United States is one of the top 16 countries at risk of Ebola from passengers arriving on commercial air flights. Professor Vespignani’s analysis went on to conclude that if we restrict air travel we reduce that risk by at least 50 percent. … “Implementing travel restrictions is the most effective way to prevent the continued spread of Ebola in this country. We strongly urge you to immediately use your authority to implement a travel ban and protect Americans from this deadly disease.” Smith previously called for officials to “review our policies for travel to and from the countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak” after a Liberian man was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas earlier this month.
10.02.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today released the following statement regarding the case of Ebola recently confirmed in Texas. “I’m glad to know that local, state, and federal officials are working to treat the patient and those he has come in contact with since re-entering the U.S. While we have compassion for those struggling with this terrible disease, our first priority must be the safety and well-being of Texans and the American public. That is why I believe it’s appropriate for us to review our policies for travel to and from the countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak.” ###
10.01.2014	San Antonio - Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to an announcement that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department will spend $9 million of taxpayer funds to provide legal representation for immigrants who illegally entered the United States during the border surge this year. Congressman Smith: “The Obama Administration has again ignored our federal immigration laws, which prohibit federal funding of legal representation to illegal immigrants before Immigration Courts. “Enforcing the law is not optional. If the President worked as hard to enforce our immigration laws as he does to consistently undermine them, he would not need to use millions in tax dollars from hard-working Americans to address the surge of illegal immigrants into Texas. “The American people agree. A recent Rasmussen survey found that seventy-one percent of voters believe illegal newcomers should not be eligible for government services and benefits.” ###

09.25.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement today in response to news that Attorney General Eric Holder is resigning as head of the Department of Justice (DOJ). Congressman Smith: “Of all the executive branch agencies, the Department of Justice is the one that should remain above politics. Yet, President Obama has repeatedly directed Attorney General Holder to ignore and undermine current laws. Under this administration, numerous scandals have plagued the DOJ, including the execution and cover-up of Operation Fast & Furious. I would also be interested to know if Attorney General Holder’s departure is tied to recent court orders demanding that DOJ release documents it has tried to hide behind executive privilege. We can only hope his successor will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.” Just this week, a U.S. district judge denied DOJ requests to delay delivery of lists of Operation Fast & Furious documents the Obama administration has been withholding under executive privilege. The department has been ordered to deliver the list of documents no later than October 22nd. Another judge has ordered the release of information to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee no later than November 1st. In June 2012, Smith voted to hold the Attorney General in criminal contempt of Congress for his failure to respond to a subpoena issued by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The contempt of Congress resolution was referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for prosecution. The House also voted to authorize the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to go to court to enforce its subpoena.
09.23.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after initial U.S. airstrikes were conducted with coalition partners in Syria against the Islamic State and groups with ties to Al Qaeda. Congressman Smith: “Our first thought should be the safety and success of all our men and women in uniform now engaged in Iraq and Syria. In the coming days, I will closely monitor the progress of our coalition efforts with our allies. I also stand ready to return to Washington to continue a healthy debate of these issues. For now, Congress has granted the only authority the president has requested. That limited train and equip authority is separate from the military actions the president is now undertaking. According to the War Powers Act, the president needs specific authorization from Congress if he plans to engage U.S. forces in hostilities for more than 60 days. I am glad the president continues to affirm his resolve to defeat the Islamic State and groups with ties to Al Qaeda who have plotted against the U.S. and our allies. Our enemies must once more fear us as we stand against forces of evil in the world that would do harm to our nation." ###
09.22.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined House Judiciary Republicans in sending a letter to President Obama and asking that he make public any plans for executive action on immigration. The White House has repeatedly confirmed plans for executive actions on immigration before the end of the year. In part, the letter reads: “You have made clear that you will take such actions without the passage of any legislation by Congress, and therefore without the input of the American public’s representatives. Additionally, it has been widely reported that you and your Administration have been meeting with select interest groups regarding their demands for administrative action on immigration. As a result, the American people have been cut out of a process that could dramatically affect their lives. “Whether it’s now or November, it is never acceptable for the Executive Branch to ignore the Constitution and unilaterally give amnesty to unlawful immigrants. Regarding actions you are planning that you believe would comply with the Constitution, the least the Administration can do is give Americans the opportunity to see the recommendations that you are considering before you take any actions. Rather than attempt to hide these actions from the American people until after the midterm elections, Americans should be given the chance to come to their own conclusions as to the merits of these recommendations. They can then exercise their constitutional right to petition the federal government and let you know their opinions.” Smith recently criticized a White House decision to delay executive action until after the November election, calling it an “open admission that the president intends to take actions that the majority of Americans oppose.” Full text of the letter signed by all 22 House Judiciary Republican members can be found here.
09.18.2014	The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology today held a hearing to examine the latest scientific research on dyslexia, the most common reading disability affecting one out of every five people. The hearing reviewed promising future research directions and treatments for people with dyslexia to overcome challenges they face, and explored educational opportunities for students with dyslexia in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “People with dyslexia think in a way that others do not. But typically in our school systems today there is not recognition, early detection, or enough teachers who are trained to spot symptoms of dyslexia early enough to get the students the intervention they need. That is why we have recently seen grass roots groups, like Decoding Dyslexia, form nationwide, and more specialized schools started to fill the gap. Unfortunately, not everyone has access to these types of schools and the learning strategies they instill in their students to help them become successful. For most people, dyslexia is a disability. But if we change the way we approach it, we can turn disability into possibility and give millions of individuals a brighter and more productive future.” Dyslexia is a developmental reading disorder characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal or above-average intelligence. The exact causes of dyslexia are not completely understood, but brain imaging studies show differences in the structure and function of the brains of people with dyslexia. Witnesses today provided impassioned testimony about personal experiences with dyslexia and how they have helped others overcome this challenge through innovative and creative problem-solving. While dyslexia is considered a learning disability, many talented people—especially in science, engineering, and the creative arts—have been diagnosed with dyslexia, including Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, and John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems. The National Science Foundation, an agency under the Science Committee’s jurisdiction, funds studies on dyslexia, and particularly, how dyslexic individuals view the universe differently due to visual-spatial skills. The lead astronomer and director of the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute has dyslexia. The National Institute of Health also studies the neuroscience of dyslexia, as well as funding studies on how dyslexic students can best learn. Witnesses today emphasized that despite common misunderstandings, dyslexia is not due to either a lack of intelligence or desire to learn, and with appropriate teaching methods, people with dyslexia can learn successfully. They also praised progress that has been made in the science behind dyslexia, saying that we don’t have a knowledge gap but gap in action. In other words, our current understanding of dyslexia is not fully utilized in either policy or practice. Over 80 members of Congress have joined the bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus, co-chaired by Reps. Bill Cassidy and Julia Brownley. The caucus helps educate the public about dyslexia and advocates for policies that support those individuals who have dyslexia. **For additional information about Dyslexia, visit Understood.org. Understood aims to give parents a direct path to the support they need, as well as information and resources to help overcome learning disabilities.
09.17.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement after voting in favor of a continuing resolution measure that would fund government operations. It also contained an amendment authored by House Armed Services Committee Chairman “Buck” McKeon (R-Calif.) to authorize train-and-equip authority as part of the effort to defeat the Islamic State. Congressman Smith: “President Obama needs to ask for authorization from Congress before taking military action. He also needs to communicate his plans and ultimate goals to Congress. Our goal should be to defeat those who call themselves the Islamic State. Congress is providing much-needed oversight today. If the president proceeds with further actions, he will need additional authorization from Congress. “It is imperative that we do everything in our power to secure the homeland against threats. I am very concerned about the security of our Southern border. I urge the Senate and President Obama to take up the border security measures recently passed by the House. A nation that is serious about the security of its people must also be serious about the security of its borders.” In addition to giving authority to train and equip vetted elements of the Syrian opposition, the McKeon amendment strengthens congressional oversight by requiring detailed progress reports on the planning and vetting process, including reports from President Obama on how efforts fit within the larger regional strategy. The McKeon amendment also explicitly states that Congress is not giving specific authorization for the use of military force.
09.17.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today made the following statement at a hearing with the president’s top science advisor, Dr. John Holdren, and the top EPA air official, Janet McCabe, examining the Obama administration’s Climate Action Plan and proposed EPA power plant regulations. Chairman Smith: “Today we look at one of the most aggressive new government programs in our country’s history. The Obama administration calls it the Climate Action Plan. “It empowers the Departments of Interior, Energy, Agriculture, Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, National Institute of Standards and Technologies, NOAA, FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the EPA to implement broad climate policies and programs with great cost and little benefit to the American people. “The cornerstone of the White House sweeping Climate Action Plan is EPA’s power plant regulation. Extending well beyond the power plants themselves, this rule will increase the cost of electricity and the cost of doing business. It will make it harder for the American people to make ends meet. “In fact, EPA’s own data show us that its power plant regulation would eliminate less than one percent of global carbon emissions. Analysis shows this would reduce sea level rise by the thickness of a mere three sheets of paper. “EPA’s mandates will be difficult for states to meet even under ideal circumstances. If energy prices or energy demand escalate, the costs of meeting those mandates will soar and American families will be forced to pay the bill. “Charles McConnell, a former Assistant Secretary for Energy appointed by President Obama, has taken the Administration to task for creating a plan doomed to fail. In a recent op-ed, Mr. McConnell asks, “Have we lost our minds? Has this administration convinced itself that it can … mandate something that is fundamentally useless? Does the EPA think the American public and global community are not capable of seeing the illusion for what it is?” “What’s clear is that by eliminating affordable, reliable power options, the regulation will increase the energy prices for the majority of Americans. That means everything will cost more – from electricity to gasoline to food. Higher costs will drive companies out of business, kill good jobs, and leave even more Americans unemployed. “Until this administration can propose a detailed strategy, tell us the total cost, and show us exactly what we will get for the sacrifice—we are just asking the American people to waste their money. “America cannot afford to drive its economy over a cliff with the hopes that the rest of the world will make the same mistake. The only economy the EPA’s plan will help is that of our competitors.” **To watch the hearing LIVE, visit the Science Committee website HERE.
09.12.2014	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today officially noticed a meeting of the Oversight Subcommittee for Wednesday, September 17, 2014, to enable Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Paul Broun (R-Ga.) to issue a subpoena to former U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, a top Assistant to President Obama during the launch of HealthCare.gov last November. After refusing to testify before the Science Committee on multiple occasions without a subpoena, Science Advisor to the President John Holdren offered for Mr. Park to brief the Oversight Subcommittee. Mr. Park scheduled a briefing for Members of the Oversight Subcommittee on Wednesday, September 10, 2014, regarding his management and oversight of the HealthCare.gov website, including security protocols. However, less than 24 hours in advance, the White House cancelled the briefing because they did not want any official transcript of the discussion. Chairman Smith: “The White House has failed to provide this Committee with information about the security of the Obamacare website. This week, the administration cancelled a briefing less than 24 hours in advance because they did not want it to be on-the-record. What is the White House trying to hide? The Obama administration has a responsibility to ensure that the personal and financial data collected by the government is secure. Last week, news reports revealed that a hacker successfully breached the Obamacare website in July. And we don’t know how many other security breaches have gone unreported. The American people deserve transparency and accountability for the security of their personal information on HealthCare.gov. That is why the Oversight Subcommittee next week will vote to subpoena this information, compelling Mr. Park to testify under oath.” Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Broun: “Since October 31st of last year, the Committee has invited Todd Park on five occasions to testify at a hearing about his knowledge of the website HealthCare.gov. The Committee also made a comprehensive request of OSTP for relevant records. To date, OSTP has failed to comply with the Committee’s requests as Members have yet to question Mr. Park about HealthCare.gov, nor have we received all responsive documents from OSTP as evidenced by those in the Committee’s possession from sources other than OSTP. OSTP’s response to the Committee is intolerable, and makes me question what other documents might be withheld not just from this Committee, but from other congressional committees. I appreciate Chairman Smith’s willingness to enable the Oversight Subcommittee to move forward with a subpoena, and I look forward to finally getting some answers from Mr. Park about HealthCare.gov.” Emails obtained by the Science Committee between Mr. Park and his colleagues appear to contradict his previous congressional testimony. The subpoena would require the White House to provide all documents and emails pertaining to Todd Park’s involvement in development of the website. It will also oblige Mr. Park to appear before the Oversight Subcommittee to provide testimony under oath. Mr. Park, who recently stepped down as Chief Technology Officer, was the co-chair of the White House’s Affordable Care Act Information Technology Exchanges Steering Committee, a body responsible for overseeing security protocols during development of the HealthCare.gov website.
09.11.2014	Congressman Smith: "Throughout U.S. history, there are moments that forever marked every American’s life. These moments include some of our country’s greatest accomplishments, such as the first human steps on the Moon 45 years ago. Others were moments of tragedy that shocked and grieved every man, woman, and child. "This week, we mark the thirteenth anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on the U.S. in American history. America will never forget the thousands who lost their lives and loved ones on that day in 2001. I will never forget that morning when a plane struck the Pentagon as I was driving by on my way to work. Those cowardly attacks forever changed the lives of thousands of Americans and their families. It also forever changed our nation. "We must remain vigilant in guarding against future attacks, while also preserving the civil liberties that make our country great. As we remember the victims of 9/11 and all the emergency personnel who risked their lives to save their fellow Americans, we thank the many men and women of our Armed Forces who have dedicated their lives to keeping America safe. Thanks to their sacrifice and service, America is still the land of the free and home of the brave. "The September 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi took the lives of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, reminding us that threats still remain. And in recent weeks we find ourselves dealing with yet another terrorist group in the Middle East that threatens the safety and security of our nation. The forces now moving across Syria and Iraq show no regard for human life or the rule of law. The brutal beheadings of two American journalists shows just what these terrorists are capable of. We must be wise as we decide what actions to take. But we must take this threat seriously, and we must defeat these terrorists who call themselves the Islamic State. "Americans remember where they were thirteen years ago today when terrorists attacked our homeland and tried to break our country’s spirit. But they also remember the sense of unity that blanketed our country as everyone came together to mourn those no longer with us. They remember the graciousness of the American people as volunteers flocked from all over to lend their time and efforts to help restore New York City. And they remember the resounding patriotism as American flags flew high on American front porches and businesses. Once more, we must remain united to stand against forces of evil in the world that would do harm to our nation and our people."
09.10.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s Wednesday evening remarks laying out his plans for addressing the threat posed by the group known as the Islamic State. Congressman Lamar Smith: "This week, we mark the thirteenth anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on the U.S. in American history. America will never forget the thousands who lost their lives and loved ones on that day in 2001. I will never forget that morning when a plane struck the Pentagon as I was driving by on my way to work. Those cowardly attacks forever changed our nation.

We must be wise as we decide what actions to take. But we must take this threat seriously, and we must defeat the terrorists who call themselves the Islamic State. "It is clear that the president has greatly underestimated ISIS, just as he underestimated that terrorist groups would be emboldened by the accelerated removal of U.S. forces from Iraq. Tonight he presented his plan for dealing with ISIS to the American people. I agree with him that we should form a broad coalition to root out, not simply 'roll back', these forces. And once we have set in motion a plan, we must stay the course. We have heard strong words before, but words alone are not enough. Over the next few days I will consult with colleagues in Congress - and my constituents – as we consider the president’s request for additional authorities.” "Americans remember where they were thirteen years ago when terrorists attacked our homeland and tried to break our country’s spirit. Once more, we must unite to stand against forces of evil in the world that would do harm to our nation and to our people." ### Congressman Smith represents the 21st District of Texas. He is a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and also serves as chairman of the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee.
09.09.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah), as well as Representatives Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), and Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), in calling for the Senate to consider the House border security package that passed before the August district work period. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The House has passed more than 340 bills that are awaiting action on the Senate doorstep. Among those bills that the Senate has not taken up, one of the most important is the bill that we are talking about today: the border security bill that we passed before the August district work period. “The president says that the House has not acted. The House has acted. The Senate is, frankly, skirting its responsibility to act itself. And the real problem here is that the president has threatened administrative amnesty. Well, the reason he has delayed his amnesty by executive order is because he is afraid of the American people. He knows that what he wants to do is not popular and not supported by the American people. And that is the problem.” The House package would end the expansion of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. It would also close loopholes in existing laws and allow Central American minors to be treated the same as Canadian and Mexican minors with regard to expedited deportations. ### Above, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) delivers remarks at a press conference with fellow lawmakers.

09.06.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today responded to reports that President Obama plans to take executive actions on immigration following the November election. Congressman Lamar Smith: "The White House's decision to delay executive action on immigration until after the election is an open admission that the president intends to take actions that the majority of Americans oppose. This is no surprise, coming from an Administration that has avoided accountability and transparency at every turn. I continue to urge the president to take measured, legal actions that Americans support to address the surge at our Southern border." Smith recently sent a letter to President Obama listing actions he could immediately take to improve the situation along the border. The letter was signed by all 24 Texas Republican Members of the House of Representatives and both Senators.
08.28.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today responded to statements from President Obama at a Thursday White House press briefing where he renewed commitment to take executive actions on immigration. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Mr. President, I’m glad you asked. For several weeks now, I have been calling on the president to act within his legal means to address serious issues on our nation’s borders. If he is truly interested in taking actions to address the recent border surge, he needs to look no further than the list of suggestions I and the entire congressional delegation of Texas Republicans recently sent him. The president could take these actions now to discourage any future border surges and reinforce, rather than undermine, existing law. “The House took action to address these issues before leaving for the August work period. If the president is serious about securing our borders and enforcing immigration laws, he will follow our lead and abandon any plans to expand amnesty and make our border problems worse.” Smith recently sent a letter to President Obama listing actions he could immediately take to improve the situation along the border. The letter was signed by all 24 Texas Republican Members of the House of Representatives and both Senators. ###
08.27.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy demanding additional information about the agency’s motivation for having detailed maps assembled showing waters and wetlands for all 50 states. The maps, which were created in 2013 shortly after EPA proposed its Waters of the U.S. rule, had never been made public. When confronted at a hearing, EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe agreed to release the maps. Chairman Smith: “These maps show the EPA’s plan: to control a huge amount of private property across the country. Given the astonishing picture they paint, I understand the EPA’s desire to minimize the importance of these maps. But the EPA’s posturing cannot explain away the alarming content of these documents. It’s time to give Americans a chance to make up their own minds about the EPA’s intentions. While the Agency marches forward with a rule that could fundamentally re-define Americans’ private property rights, the EPA kept these maps hidden. So, today I will be posting the maps on the Committee’s website for public review.” While the EPA has claimed the maps have not yet been used to regulate, they have failed to explain why the agency used taxpayer money to create them. The EPA paid a private contractor to make many of these maps, yet the details of the arrangement have not been disclosed. Serious questions remain regarding the EPA’s underlying motivations for creating such highly detailed maps that were created just days after the EPA announced its Waters of the U.S. rule. The letter requests all documents and communications related to the EPA’s contract to create these maps and demands that these and any other previously undisclosed maps in the EPA’s possession be entered into the official rulemaking docket for public review and comment. The letter also requests EPA keep the public comment period open for at least 60 days to provide adequate opportunity for public review and comment. The full letter can be found here. The maps are posted here.
08.13.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy criticizing the agency’s limited analysis of its climate regulations and requesting more comprehensive, independent analysis before the agency moves forward. “For too long the EPA has hidden the truth from the American people. In order to regain public trust, the agency should rely on robust, objective and well-grounded technical analysis of its climate regulations. Flaws in recent EPA analyses amplify concerns about the real impacts of these regulations. Americans deserve an opportunity to see the facts.” Last week the Government Accountability Office released a report highlighting a pattern of shoddy EPA analysis. It was revealed that EPA relied on decades old data and ignored important factors. The independent watchdog warned that “EPA cannot ensure that it’s [analysis] provide the public with a clear understanding of its decision making.” In his letter, Chairman Smith wrote that “Credible analysis is critical to a well-informed debate concerning climate change and energy policy choices now before American people. EPA’s incomplete modeling disregards a number of technical, regulatory, and economic realities. Americans deserve the bottom line: what does it cost and what will we get for the money?” The letter calls on EPA to provide comprehensive analysis that takes real-world contingencies into account rather than rely on models and science that are hidden from the public. Chairman Smith simultaneously sent a letter to the non-partisan Energy Information Administration (EIA) to conduct independent analysis using the same underlying data and assumptions that EPA uses. The letter states that “tandem analysis by EPA and EIA would allow for a side-by-side comparison of results and provide a more comprehensive accounting of the possible impacts of the agency’s proposal.” The letter requests the analysis be conducted by September 15, 2014.
08.04.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to news that several shelters for illegal immigrants on military bases, including Lackland Air Force Base, are expected to close in the coming weeks. Congressman Lamar Smith: “I’m glad to hear that the Obama administration plans to stop housing illegal immigrants at military facilities like Lackland Air Force Base. Were it not for the president’s policies, these facilities would never have had to house the thousands who have come across our Southern border. Now he must also act to address the root of the problems along the border- his own policies. In addition to ending the use of military bases as shelters, the president should focus on enforcing current immigration laws rather than threatening new actions outside of his authority. “Many Americans support the common-sense provisions within the House bills that we passed last week, and an overwhelming majority do not think the president is doing a good job of handling immigration issues. I hope the president will listen to the American people and act today to enforce current immigration laws and prevent further increases in the border surge.” The House package that passed on Friday prohibits housing unauthorized immigrants on military bases if doing so will displace active duty military personnel or interfere with military activities at the installation. It also includes language to end the expansion of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. It would also close loopholes in existing laws and allow Central American minors to be treated the same as Canadian and Mexican minors with regard to expedited deportations. A recent Associated Press- GfK Public Affairs poll showed that a majority of participants favored changing current law so that illegal immigrants from other countries are treated the same as those from Mexico or Canada, which can be sent back to their home countries without a deportation hearing. Smith also recently sent a letter to President Obama listing actions he could immediately take to improve the situation along the border. The letter was signed by all 24 Texas Republican Members of the House of Representatives and both Senators.
08.01.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to statements made by President Obama characterizing a House border package as ‘extreme.' Congressman Lamar Smith: “There’s nothing extreme about the House bills with border solutions Americans support. Recent polling shows that many Americans support specific provisions within our bill, and an overwhelming majority do not think the president is doing a good job of handling immigration issues. Given the choice to stand with the president or the American people, I’d choose to stand on the side of the American people any day. “The House bills contain strong language to address the border crisis. The crisis was created when the president issued an executive order to allow almost a million illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. The House stayed in town to address these issues before the August work period. The Senate should come back and do its job. And the president should focus on enforcing current immigration laws rather than threatening new actions outside of his authority. “It is a shame the president has refused to take responsibility for his actions that created this crisis, and that he has refused to halt the border surge by enforcing current immigration laws. Contrary to his oath of office to enforce laws, he has given amnesty to almost a million illegal immigrants in the U.S. And he has repeatedly threatened to take even more unlawful actions to expand amnesty and make the current border problems worse. The only actions he should take in the coming weeks are to enforce current immigration laws and reverse his policies that got us into this mess in the first place.�? The House package includes language authored by Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tennessee) that Rep. Smith cosponsored last week. That bill would end the expansion of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. It would also close loopholes in existing laws and allow Central American minors to be treated the same as Canadian and Mexican minors with regard to expedited deportations. Smith recently sent a letter to President Obama listing actions he could immediately take to improve the situation along the border. The letter was signed by all 24 Texas Republican Members of the House of Representatives and both Senators.
07.31.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today released the following statement regarding the current situation on the U.S. Southern border. Congressman Lamar Smith: “The president owns the border crisis because his policies created it. He needs to take responsibility for his own actions. Contrary to his oath of office to enforce laws, he has given amnesty to almost a million illegal immigrants in the U.S. This has inevitably led to more illegal immigration. The president could halt the border surge now if he enforced current immigration law. He has decided not to fix this problem. “The president has repeatedly threatened to take even more unlawful actions to expand amnesty and make the current border problems worse. That is one of the reasons why I voted this week to bring a lawsuit against the Obama administration. In addition to the president’s failure to implement Obamacare, the border crisis is another grievance the American people have with this runaway presidency.” Smith recently sent a letter to President Obama listing actions he could immediately take to improve the situation along the border. The letter was signed by all 24 Texas Republican Members of the House of Representatives and both Senators.
07.31.2014	The Subcommittee on Research and Technology and the Subcommittee on Oversight today held a joint hearing on the technologies needed to better secure our nation’s borders. Congressman Smith, who chairs the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, attended today’s subcommittee hearing and issued the following statement. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “Technology is a key component to securing our 2,000 mile Southern border. Customs and Border Protection and National Guard troops cannot be everywhere. Sensors deployed along the border can detect and track the “coyotes” who smuggle children—as well as illegal drugs and firearms—across the border. We need to get this technology in the hands of our immigration officers. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security has a poor track record when it comes to developing and fielding sensors and tactical communications infrastructure along the Southwest border.” In 2002, the Homeland Security Act established the Directorate for Science and Technology (S&T) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The S&T Directorate manages and carries out science and technology research for our federal homeland security needs. It is responsible for developing new technologies that can help secure our nation’s border. A 2012 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report notes that, “The Department of Homeland Security does not know the total amount its components invest in research and development.” While DHS has since provided a definition for R&D, GAO testified today that it has “not yet determined the most effective path to guide R&D across the department.” Further, a 2013 GAO report cites examples where projects were delayed and cancelled due to an inability to obtain data from DHS. The following witnesses testified today:Dr. K. Jack Riley, Vice President, RAND National Security Research Division; Director, RAND National Defense Research Institute;Mr. David C. Maurer, Director, Homeland Security and Justice, U.S. Government Accountability Office; andDr. Joseph D. Eyerman, Director, Health Security Program, RTI International; Director for Research and Management, Institute for Homeland Security Solutions, Duke University. The Committee plans to hold a follow-on hearing in September with the Undersecretary of Science and Technology to inform upcoming legislation to reauthorize research and technology development projects at the DHS S&T Directorate.

07.30.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in favor of Veterans Affairs legislation that would expand access to care for veterans, expedite the firing of negligent VA employees, provide for additional medical staff, and lease facilities for 27 new VA hospitals and clinics. Specifically, the legislation would consolidate several San Antonio-area clinics into a new, 191,000 square foot facility as part of a broader VA medical facilities lease plan. Congressman Lamar Smith: “America’s veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms. They deserve the best health care, not delayed health care. This bill starts moving the VA in the right direction. “This legislation will benefit thousands of veterans in San Antonio and across the 21st Congressional District of Texas who have been subjected to unacceptable delays in care. This bill balances increased access to care for veterans with increased accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs.” The measure, which was championed by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller of Florida, also received praise from groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), the Disabled Veterans of America (DAV), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), and the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP). Similar to legislation Rep. Smith supported earlier this summer, this bill would allow veterans who experience wait times longer than 30 days, and those living more than 40 miles from a VA facility, to seek private care at the expense of the VA. It would also give the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs more authority to fire employees guilty of wrongdoing. The legislation would also require the VA to combine several San Antonio-area medical and benefits facilities into one new 191,000 square foot facility to ease access for veterans seeking any number of services. Specifically, the bill would consolidate the Frank Tejada Outpatient Clinic, two existing annexes, three existing specialty care clinics, one contract clinic and Veterans Benefits Administration offices into a single, one-stop-shop facility. The new facility would integrate medical and surgical care facilities with laboratory, pathology and radiology services in order to decrease visits for patients and deliver test results on the same day of appointment.
07.30.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today released the following statement in anticipation of a House measure to bring suit against President Obama for failure to implement Obamacare provisions from 2010. Congressman Lamar Smith: “This is more than an empty suit: the American people have a long list of grievances that merit the legal action being pursued by the House of Representatives. In addition to changing the terms of Obamacare, the president has ignored, undermined, and gone around Congress to create new immigration laws. This has created the current crisis on our border and significantly weakened our nation’s security. Yet this president continues to threaten even more overreaching executive actions to extend amnesty to millions. “The time has come for a lawsuit to hold this runaway presidency accountable. The Constitution says the president must faithfully execute the laws. However, the current president believes he has the power to make his own laws. But no president has the power to make laws on their own. “We have an obligation to defend the Constitution and the balance of powers our government has had for more than 200 years.”
07.25.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in favor of the Child Tax Credit Improvement Act. Congressman Lamar Smith: “Child Tax Credits have traditionally been a way our government recognizes the valuable role families play in caring for the next generation. By allowing parents to keep more of their hard-earned money, this bill will give working families a much-needed boost. “In addition, it also reins in bad IRS policies that have paid out more than $4.2 billion in taxpayer dollars to millions of illegal immigrants. Our bill puts an end to this egregious waste of taxpayer dollars and ensures our policies place the highest priorities on working American families.”
07.24.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today sent a letter to President Obama signed by all 24 Texas Republican Members of the House of Representatives and both Senators. The letter in part read: “Mr. President, you have the authority to stop the surge of illegal entries by immigrant minors today. Enforcing current immigration laws will go a long way to solving the border crisis.” Complete text of the letter can be found below: July 24, 2014 President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President, As members of the Texas delegation, we watch our state endure the impact of illegal immigrant children streaming across our border. Our hearts go out to those who have suffered during their long journeys to the United States. But we cannot allow this tragedy to continue. A country that has lost control of its borders has lost control of its future. Mr. President, you have the authority to stop the surge of illegal entries by immigrant minors today. Enforcing current immigration laws will go a long way to solving the border crisis. We therefore urge you to take the following actions to address the current national security and humanitarian crisis on the Southern Border: 1. Suspend your efforts to issue new Executive Orders that weaken enforcement of our immigration laws. Your Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Executive Order has shielded over half a million illegal immigrants from current law. And it has sent the regrettable message that illegal immigration will not be punished in the United States. 2. End the catch-and-release policy that gives convicted criminal immigrants and illegal immigrants a free pass. Last year, 36,000 criminal immigrants with 88,000 convictions were released from jail to roam our neighborhoods and commit additional crimes instead of being detained and deported. 3. Improve cooperation with local law enforcement agencies so they can help enforce our immigration laws and identify criminal immigrants. 4. Don’t tolerate immigration fraud, which encourages more illegal immigrants to make false claims so they can remain in the United States. 5. Expedite the processing and removal of illegal immigrants who are apprehended at our Southern Border. We can only deter future waves of illegal immigration through swift and certain enforcement of our immigration laws. Your administration has used existing laws as an excuse for your failure to end the national security and humanitarian crisis on our Southern Border. However, the majority of immigrants apprehended at the border during this crisis can be legally repatriated immediately. Instead, you have permitted almost all to remain in the United States, further encouraging illegal immigration. Please take the actions cited above to enforce our immigration laws and restore order on the Southern Border. This will save lives and discourage those you have enticed to enter illegally through your current policies. Twenty-five members joined Rep. Smith in calling for the President to stop the illegal surge on the southern border, including: Rep. Joe Barton (TX-06), Rep. Kevin Brady (TX-08), Rep. Michael Burgess (TX-26), Rep. John Carter (TX-31), Rep. Michael Conaway (TX-11), Rep. John Culberson (TX-07), Rep. Blake Farenthold (TX-27), Rep. Bill Flores (TX-17), Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01), Rep. Kay Granger (TX-12), Rep. Ralph Hall (TX-04), Rep. Jeb Hensarling (TX-05), Rep. Sam Johnson (TX-03), Rep. Kenny Marchant (TX-24), Rep. Michael McCaul (TX-10), Rep. Randy Neugebauer (TX-19), Rep. Pete Olson (TX-22), Rep. Ted Poe (TX-02), Rep. Pete Sessions (TX-32), Steve Stockman (TX-36), Rep. Mac Thornberry (TX-13), Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14), Rep. Roger Williams (TX-25), Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).
07.17.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today supported a new proposal to address the crisis of increased illegal border crossings along the U.S. Southern border. Smith joined Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) in introducing H.R. 5137, the Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act. Congressman Smith: "The crisis on our Southern border has directly impacted millions in the Lone Star State and put the lives of tens of thousands of immigrants in jeopardy. But this is not simply a Texas problem. Community after community across the nation faces the reality of illegal immigrants being dropped off at their doorstep. Right now, every American lives on the border. "Unlike the president’s funding request, our solution actually gets to the root of the problem: President Obama's policies as enacted by executive order and overly broad application of existing law. Our proposal expedites deportations and drastically restricts measures by which individuals might try to falsely claim asylum. I will continue to urge the President to take common-sense steps to clean up the mess that he created." The Obama Administration has broadly applied a 2008 law - originally intended to assist trafficking victims - to allow tens of thousands of accompanied and unaccompanied minors to stay in the United States. The Administration has also used broad prosecutorial discretion to grant asylum to thousands streaming across the border. Other key components of the Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act: Fast-tracks the removal of unaccompanied alien minors: Under the bill, all unaccompanied alien minors will be placed in expedited removal proceedings so they can be almost immediately returned home, unless they have a legitimate credible fear of persecution in their home country. Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security is unable to put Central American minors in expedited removal proceedings. As a result, they are released into our communities and are told to appear before an immigration judge years later. Many of them never show up for their hearing. Makes sure minors are returned home safely: The bill provides that the Secretary of State shall negotiate agreements with other countries regarding the safe repatriation of minors, just as the Secretary does now for countries contiguous to the U.S. Implements tougher standards for “credible fear” claims: In order to evade expedited removal proceedings, family units caught along the border or at ports of entry often claim a “credible fear” of persecution in their home countries and seek a hearing before an immigration judge. While awaiting the hearing, they are released into the U.S. and receive work authorization while their case is pending. The Obama Administration granted approximately 92% of all “credible fear” cases decided on the merits in Fiscal Year 2013, many of which were fraudulent and baseless. In fact, “credible fear” claims have increased 586% from 2007 to 2013 as word has spread about the rubberstamping of applications. The bill tightens the “credible fear” standard to weed out baseless claims. It also tightens the standard for release from detention under parole authority so that the Obama Administration doesn’t automatically release them before their claims are proved legitimate. Cracks down on asylum fraud: Under the bill, unaccompanied alien minors will not have preferred access to asylum that is not available to others. To reduce fraud, they are required to apply for asylum within a year of entry into the U.S. and are placed in removal proceedings. Protects our communities from gang members: The bill makes members of violent criminal gangs inadmissible to the United States and ineligible for asylum so that unaccompanied alien minor gang members can be more easily removed. Gives Border Patrol access to federal lands: Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector cite restrictions that bar access to federal lands as a significant stumbling block to securing the border. The Departments of Interior and Agriculture currently have rules that prevent Border Patrol agents from accessing federal lands near the border under the guise of environmental preservation. As a result, federal lands along the border provide drug traffickers, human smugglers, and unlawful immigrants effective routes and hiding places where Border Patrol agents cannot reach them. The bill contains language from Rep. Rob Bishop’s legislation to stop this foolish policy and give Border Patrol access to federal lands along the border. Protects American taxpayers: The Obama Administration wants American taxpayers to foot the bill for lawyers for unaccompanied alien minors in removal proceedings. While the law currently prohibits taxpayer dollars being used to pay for lawyers for unlawful immigrants, the bill makes this prohibition even more explicit to stop the Administration’s plan. Provides additional immigration judges and ICE prosecutors: The bill provides a temporary allotment of immigration judges and ICE prosecutors in order to deal with the surge at the border.
07.14.2014	The House of Representatives today approved the STEM Education Act of 2014 (H.R. 5031), introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). The STEM Education Act of 2014 strengthens ongoing science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education efforts and ensures computer science is included in these efforts. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said: “We need to ensure that young adults have the scientific and mathematical skills to strive and thrive in a technology-based economy. But we have to capture and hold the desire of our nation’s youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A healthy and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects including computer science, is critical to American industries. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America.”
07.08.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to President Obama’s request for $3.7 billion additional taxpayer dollars for immigration efforts. Congressman Smith: “This isn’t a funding problem, it’s an enforcement problem. Rather than enforce our nation’s immigration laws, the President has chosen to ignore them. Instead, he continues to call for massive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants. “The President has no one to blame but himself for the current crisis on the Southern border. He granted amnesty to illegal immigrant minors by promising not to deport those brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. As a result, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants are now flooding across the border. “I’d be happy to give the President $3.7 billion to secure the border if I thought he’d actually do it. But time and again President Obama has shown that he cares more about the interests of illegal immigrants than of law abiding citizens. “Congress shouldn’t give President Obama a single penny until we see him use the current resources to secure the border, increase interior enforcement, and reduce illegal immigration.”
06.30.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to President Obama’s decision to pursue amnesty by executive action. Congressman Smith: “When it comes to the crisis on the border, President Obama has no one to blame but himself. He is the one who promised amnesty to illegal immigrant minors already in the U.S. As a result, tens of thousands of illegal immigrant minors are now flooding across the border. Why are they coming? Because of the promise of legalization and amnesty that President Obama advocates. “It is laughable that President Obama now is trying to point the finger at House Republicans. We’re the ones who have been calling for border security rather than amnesty. The President insists that the Senate amnesty bill will improve our immigration system. But amnesty is not the answer. “As we’ve seen in the past, amnesty only encourages more illegal immigration. We saw it after the ’86 amnesty. Congress legalized three million illegal immigrants. And what happened? More illegal immigrants came to the U.S. There are now 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., and an estimated seven million working here illegally. “The Founders in Constitution gave Congress the right to establish immigration laws – not the President. His job is to enforce the laws enacted by Congress. We don’t need amnesty. We need border security. And we need a President who will enforce all of our nation’s immigration laws, not just a select few. “If the President insists on enacting amnesty by executive order, he will undoubtedly face a lawsuit and will find himself, once again, on the wrong side of the Constitution and the law.”
06.30.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to today’s Supreme Court ruling regarding the Obamacare contraceptives mandate. Congressman Smith: “Today is a victory for religious freedom across America. The Supreme Court rightly affirmed that the Obama administration cannot require family-owned companies to provide a product or service in violation of their religious beliefs. It upholds the idea that companies can have a conscience. “There are many reasons to oppose Obamacare, but the contraceptives mandate strikes at the core of our constitutional rights – freedom of religion. The President believes that universal health care is a right; and he places it above the rights of employers to freely exercise their religious beliefs. “But only one of these is a right guaranteed by our Founding Fathers in the Constitution. The First Amendment prevents the government from establishing laws that prohibit the free exercise of religion. This decision rejects the President’s overreach of authority and restores religious rights to the people.” Under Obamacare, employers providing health insurance to employees must cover 20 forms of birth control, including the morning after pill, on their insurance plans. In 2012, Hobby Lobby challenged the regulation because of concerns regarding the morning after pill. While Hobby Lobby already covers 16 forms of contraception in their health insurance plans, they decline to cover those that can destroy an embryo, which violates some churches’ doctrine on the sanctity of life. Hobby Lobby is not alone in its concerns. More than 90 cases were filed representing 300 plaintiffs challenging Obamacare’s “contraceptives mandate.” Congressman Smith joined in several amicus briefs supporting the company’s right to exercise freedom of religion.
06.26.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement following the Supreme Court’s ruling that President Obama violated the U.S. Constitution by appointing individuals to the National Labor Relations Board without the Senate’s approval. Rep. Smith: “Today the Supreme Court rightly reined in President Obama's abuse of executive authority. The Court affirmed that the President's appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were unprecedented and unconstitutional. "The founders established a system of government with checks and balances, so that no branch of government could unilaterally impose its will on the American people. The Constitution grants the Senate the power to provide advice and consent on certain executive branch nominees. In its attempt to circumvent Senate approval process, the Obama administration disregarded the Constitution. "But all government officials are bound by the limits of the Constitution and the rule of law, including the President of the United States. And today the Court provided a much needed check against the President’s abuse of power.”
06.26.2014	The Research & Technology and Oversight subcommittees today held a joint hearing to assess the potential benefits of new technologies to prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). There have been high percentages of HAI and mortality rates among patients at some Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals. Congressman Smith, who chairs the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, attended today’s subcommittee hearing and issued the following statement.Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “Americans are rightly outraged about the long delays and unacceptable quality of VA health care for tens of thousands of our veterans. Following up on a series of letters to the VA Inspector General and others, I recently met with Acting VA Secretary Gibson at the Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital in my district in San Antonio. I was reassured that he sincerely wants to fix the problems facing our veterans. But we need swift action and strong resolve to fix such a broken system at the VA. “Hospital-acquired infections are a serious public health problem that affects patients in hospitals all across the country. A number of VA hospitals are among the worst in the United States in terms of inflicting preventable infections on their patients. American veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms. Veterans who live in the 21st Congressional District of Texas and across our country should have the best health care America can provide, as soon as possible.” Hospital acquired infections are the most common complication of hospital care. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates 1.7 million HAIs per year in the U.S. causing or contributing to up to 99,000 deaths annually. Research supported by the National Science Foundation in robotics, nanotechnology, and other areas of the biological sciences has helped to bring about technological innovations to prevent HAIs. For more information about today’s hearing, please visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
06.10.2014	The House of Representatives today passed the Veterans Access to Care Act (H.R. 4810) to address current delays facing tens-of-thousands of veterans seeking care through the VA. Congressman Smith supported the bill, which allows enrolled veterans to obtain non-VA care when they cannot get an appointment within the VA’s 14-day wait time window. The bill provides the same benefit to veterans who live more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility. The Act also bans bonuses for VA employees for two years, and requires the VA to submit quarterly reports to Congress on the Department’s efforts to improve veterans’ access to care. Rep. Smith: “Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are outraged by the recent VA scandal, which has left over 57,000 veterans across the country waiting for care. In San Antonio alone, 837 veterans are stuck in a wait list limbo. This is inexcusable. America’s veterans deserve the best care possible, as soon as possible. “The Veterans Access to Care Act gives veterans immediate access to the health care. The bill ensures that if a veteran cannot get an appointment with the VA, they are able to access care outside the VA system at no additional cost to themselves. “This is a good, bipartisan bill that provides immediate relief to the tens-of-thousands of veterans currently waiting for care. America’s veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms. The least we can do is make sure that they have timely access to the medical treatment they need and deserve.” Yesterday, the Department of Veterans Affairs released the results of a nationwide audit that examined problems surrounding access to care for millions of America’s veterans. According to the report, schedulers at 76% of VA facilities had engaged in the practice of misreporting appointment requests to hide long waitlists for veterans seeking care. Thirteen percent of scheduling staff interviewed said that they had received direct instruction from supervisors or others to falsify medical appointment records. The audit flagged certain VA facilities for further investigation and review, including Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in the 21st District of Texas. Last week, Congressman Smith met with Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Sloan D. Gibson to discuss recent allegations of misconduct at Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital. On June 4, Congressman Smith sent a letter to VA Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin regarding reports from employees at Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital that senior managers had directed schedulers to hide evidence of delays for veterans seeking care. Rep. Smith raised concerns about the independence and integrity of the IG investigation in light of reports that investigators were only interviewing schedulers who were hand-picked and coached by senior management.

Last week, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) met with Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Sloan D. Gibson to discuss recent allegations of misconduct at Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital. Congressman Smith issued the following statement in response to today’s audit. Rep. Smith: “According to the VA audit, more than 800 San Antonio veterans are waiting for care. Last week, I met with a veteran who has been waiting more than two years for oral surgery. This is inexcusable. America’s veterans deserve the best care possible, as soon as possible. “Today’s audit confirms the Inspector General’s reports that the VA’s scheduling schemes are systemic. According to the audit, misreporting practices took place in 76% of VA facilities across the country. In San Antonio alone, 837 veterans are waiting to receive care. “I recently met with Secretary Gibson to discuss what the VA is doing to help San Antonio veterans who are stuck on long waitlists. I was reassured that he sincerely wants to fix the problem. And I appreciate that he is taking seriously the new allegations of misconduct at Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital in my district. Further review at Audie Murphy Hospital is needed to help make sure that San Antonio veterans get the care they need and deserve. “America’s veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms. They deserve the best health care, not delayed health care. I am committed to continuing to fight to ensure that San Antonio veterans have the best care that our nation can provide.” On June 4, Congressman Smith sent a letter to VA Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin regarding reports from employees at Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital that senior managers had directed schedulers to hide evidence of delays for veterans seeking care. In the June 4 letter, Rep. Smith raised concerns about the independence and integrity of the IG investigation in light of reports that investigators were only interviewing schedulers who were hand-picked and coached by senior management. Last month, Rep. Smith sent a letter to IG Griffin calling on him to immediately initiate an investigation into allegations of misconduct at three VA facilities in Texas. According to media reports, employees at the North Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic and Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were instructed by supervisors to ensure that wait times for veterans were as “close to zero days as possible.” An employee of Veterans Affairs who recently worked at all three clinics claims that staffers falsely logged patients’ desired appointment dates to closely coincide with appointment openings. But in reality, veterans were left waiting for months. On May 27, IG Griffin responded to Rep. Smith confirming that his office is investigating allegations of misconduct at the three Central Texas VA facilities.
06.06.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today met with Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Sloan D. Gibson regarding new allegations of misconduct and long wait lists at local VA facilities. Rep. Smith met with Secretary Gibson at the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital and pressed the Secretary on what the VA is doing today to help San Antonio veterans seeking care. Rep. Smith: “The national crisis at the VA has millions of Americans rightfully outraged. Unfortunately, the serious problems at the VA have hit too close to home. There have been reports of misconduct, long wait lists and delayed care at several Central Texas VA facilities, including Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital in my district. “Earlier today, I met with a veteran who has been waiting more than two years for oral surgery. This is inexcusable. America’s veterans deserve the best care possible, as soon as possible. “I appreciate Secretary Gibson being in San Antonio today. During our meeting, I was reassured that he sincerely wants to help correct the problems facing our veterans. We need swift action and strong resolve to fix the broken system at the VA. “America’s veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms. They deserve the best health care, not delayed health care.

Last month, Rep. Smith sent a letter to IG Griffin calling on him to immediately initiate an investigation into allegations of misconduct at three VA facilities in Texas. Smith was joined by 23 members of the Texas delegation in sending the letter. According to media reports, employees at the North Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic and Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were instructed by supervisors to ensure that wait times for veterans were as “close to zero days as possible.” An employee of Veterans Affairs who recently worked at all three clinics claims that staffers falsely logged patients’ desired appointment dates to closely coincide with appointment openings.

06.04.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today sent a new letter to Acting Inspector General of Veterans Affairs Richard Griffin requesting additional information regarding the investigation into allegations of misconduct at local VA facilities. Specifically, Rep. Smith pressed the IG on new reports from employees at Audie Murphy Memorial Hospital that senior managers at the hospital had directed schedulers to hide evidence of delays for veterans seeking care. In his letter, Rep. Smith raised concerns about the independence and integrity of the IG investigation in light of reports that investigators were only interviewing schedulers who were hand-picked and coached by senior management. Congressman Smith pressed the IG on specifics regarding the investigation, including how many IG investigators are on the ground in San Antonio, as well as whether the interviews are taking place in person or over the phone. Rep. Smith raised concerns that “managers sit in on these interviews and instruct employees not to be forthcoming with OIG staff.” “If this is true,” Rep. Smith questioned, “how can you claim that your investigation is an independent and comprehensive review?” A full copy of the letter to the IG can be found here. Last month, Rep. Smith sent a letter to IG Griffin calling on him to immediately initiate an investigation into allegations of misconduct at three VA facilities in Texas. According to media reports, employees at the North Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic and Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were instructed by supervisors to ensure that wait times for veterans were as “close to zero days as possible.” An employee of Veterans Affairs who recently worked at all three clinics claims that staffers falsely logged patients’ desired appointment dates to closely coincide with appointment openings.

06.03.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement on the Obama administration’s decision to negotiate with the Taliban and release five dangerous terrorists from Guantanamo Bay without consulting with Congress. Rep. Smith: “The President’s decision to release five of the most dangerous and deadly terrorists at Guantanamo Bay has serious national security consequences. It’s dangerous for any president to negotiate with terrorists because it only encourages them to take more hostages. It’s a troubling precedent that puts Americans serving overseas at even greater risk. “We know President Obama has long opposed holding prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. But if this is a backdoor way to achieve his political goal of closing Gitmo, it comes at a high price to our national security. Of the five terrorists released by President Obama, two are responsible for thousands of deaths. “This is not the kind of decision that the Commander-in-Chief should make unilaterally. The law clearly states that the President must give Congress 30-days’ notice before transferring prisoners out of Gitmo. According to media reports, the Administration had been in negotiations with the Taliban for nearly five months. And yet, Congress was not notified of the transfer until after-the-fact, once the deed had been done. “The President should have followed the law and consulted with Congress before releasing five dangerous terrorists back onto the battlefield. Congress is going to hold hearings and we will get to the bottom of the Administration’s decision to ignore its legal obligation to report to Congress before transferring terrorists out of Gitmo.”
06.02.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement in response to the Obama administration’s announcement of stringent new EPA carbon regulations for existing power plants. Chairman Smith: “The President’s plan forces costly and unnecessary regulations on hardworking American families. The Clean Air Act was never intended to regulate carbon. The EPA’s plan is ‘all pain, no gain.’ It will close power plants and drive up electricity prices. These regulations will mean more jobs lost to places like China and India. “We all want to protect the environment. But the Obama administration should stop trying to scare Americans without scientific evidence to back up their claims. U.S. emissions have already declined by 9% from 2008 to 2012. And studies show that dramatically cutting carbon emissions in the U.S. will have little impact on global temperature in the future. “A better solution is to focus on technological innovations that cut energy costs, create jobs and can be used world-wide. Instead, the President continues to push a radical environmental agenda that kills jobs in the U.S. and costs American families. These regulations mean more government control and less freedom for Americans.”
06.02.2014	The House of Representatives has passed the Intelligence Authorization Act (H.R. 4681) to ensure that our intelligence community has the tools it needs to protect Americans from terrorist attacks both here at home and abroad. Approved on May 30, the bill also included an important provision authored by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) to increase accountability within our intelligence community and better protects civil liberties. The NSA Internal Watchdog Act (H.R. 4533) creates a Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed Inspector General (IG) for the NSA, placing a powerful and independent watchdog inside the agency who is accountable to Congress and the American people. The bill helps assure the public that their privacy is protected while maintaining the tools our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep America secure. Congressman Smith introduced the NSA Internal Watchdog Act with Representatives Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Jim Himes (D-Conn.). Rep. Smith: “Our intelligence community has a responsibility not only to protect our national security, but also to respect our civil liberties. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, Congress gave the intelligence community additional authority to help detect and deter terrorist threats facing our nation. Over a decade later, we are still engaged in a global fight with radical Islamic terrorist organizations. To keep America safe, we must use every tool available to us. “But that does not mean that our civil liberties should be ignored in the name of national security. The NSA Internal Watchdog Act enhances the role of the NSA Inspector General and guarantees there is an independent investigator keeping a careful eye on the actions of the intelligence community. The bill empowers the NSA’s internal watchdog to prevent abuses of authority and violations of the law within the intelligence community. By increasing accountability, this bill helps safeguard American lives and liberties.” Under H.R. 4533, the new NSA IG will be able to: Ensure all NSA programs and activities comply with our laws and Constitution. Recommend new NSA policies to protect our civil rights and civil liberties. Exercise subpoena power to require contractors and former NSA employees to give testimony in IG investigations, a power that no IG other than the Department of Defense IG currently has. Prevent personal snooping or any other misuses of NSA programs by rogue employees and contractors, such as investigating ex-spouses. Challenge, through Congress, any attempted prohibition of an IG audit or investigation due to alleged national security grounds.
05.28.2014	Veterans Affairs Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin has confirmed that his office is investigating allegations of misconduct at three Central Texas VA facilities: the North Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic and Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In a letter to Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) and 23 members of the Texas delegation, the IG stated that his office is actively investigating allegations that employees manipulated medical records to conceal long wait times for veterans seeking care. The IG said that he expects the investigation to be completed by August and promised a full report to Congress at that time. Rep. Smith issued the following statement in response to the IG’s letter. Congressman Smith: “I am pleased to hear that the Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General has confirmed they are investigating serious allegations of misconduct at three Texas VA facilities. “Americans across the country are rightly outraged by reports that VA employees doctored medical records to conceal long wait times for sick veterans in need of care. President Obama recently echoed the concerns of millions of Americans regarding the serious allegations. But where was the President’s outrage five years ago when his staff was initially told about the problems at the VA? In 2008, the President’s transition team was warned about long wait times, scheduling problems, and even concerns about denial of care to deserving veterans. “We need more than outrage from the President; we need swift action to protect the health and well-being of our veterans. An independent investigation by the Inspector General is a first start. We must make sure that the IG investigators have all the tools and resources they need to get to the bottom of these troubling allegations. “Anyone found to have violated the law should be prosecuted. And anyone who engaged in misconduct should be fired. Our nation’s veterans dedicate their lives to protecting America and keeping us safe. We have a solemn duty to ensure that they receive the very best medical care our nation has to offer.” Earlier this month, Rep. Smith sent a letter to Veterans Affairs Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin calling for an immediate investigation into allegations of misconduct at three VA facilities in Texas. According to media reports, employees at the North Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic and Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were instructed by supervisors to ensure that wait times for veterans were as “close to zero days as possible.” An employee of Veterans Affairs who recently worked at all three clinics claims that staffers falsely logged patients’ desired appointment dates to closely coincide with appointment openings. But in reality, veterans were left waiting for months. Smith was joined by 23 members of the Texas delegation in sending the letter.
05.21.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in favor of H.R. 4031, the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014. The House passed the bill by a vote of 390- 33. The bill gives the Secretary of Veterans Affairs authority to remove an employee of the Senior Executive Service if the Secretary determines that the employee’s performance deserves removal. Congressman Smith: “Today I voted in favor of H.R. 4031, the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014. The passage of this bill occurs at a particularly important time as the bill makes it easier to fire or demote senior officials at the VA. Given the recent allegations that VA officials in Texas manipulated medical appointment data in order to conceal long wait times for veterans seeking care, this bill will help to hold those individuals accountable. Our veterans have risked their lives so that all Americans might be free. The least we can do is ensure that they have timely access to the medical treatment they have earned. “In addition to voting in favor of H.R. 4031, last week I spearheaded a letter along with 23 members of the Texas delegation to Veterans Affairs Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin calling on him to immediately initiate an investigation into claims of waitlist manipulation at the North Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic and the Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. I stand by that letter, and once again call for an investigation into these allegations. The 21st Congressional District is home to many veterans, current members of the military and their families. I will continue to make sure that our veterans have timely access to the medical care they have earned.”
05.13.2014	Members of the Texas delegation today called for an Inspector General investigation into allegations that Veterans Affairs officials in Central Texas manipulated medical appointment data in order to conceal long wait times for veterans seeking care. According to media reports, employees at the North Central Federal Clinic in San Antonio, the Austin Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic and Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center were instructed by supervisors to ensure that wait times for veterans were as “close to zero days as possible.” An employee of Veterans Affairs who recently worked at all three clinics claims that staffers falsely logged patients’ desired appointment dates to closely coincide with appointment openings. But in reality, veterans were left waiting for months. These new allegations come on the heels of reports that at least 40 veterans in Phoenix died while waiting to receive care. Led by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), members of the Texas delegation wrote Veterans Affairs Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin calling on him to immediately initiate investigations into all three VA facilities. “The policy of falsifying medical records is dishonest, deceptive, and injurious to veterans,” wrote the members. “Swift action must be taken to protect the health and well-being of our nation’s veterans.” “We understand that your office has staff in San Antonio reviewing these allegations,” the letter continued. “However, we want to make sure that your office is also investigating the potential misconduct that may have affected veterans seeking care in Waco and Austin. Any individuals found to have engaged in misconduct or mismanagement must face serious consequences.” The members urged Inspector General Griffin to “expeditiously and thoroughly investigate the claims regarding misconduct” and report back to Congress on his findings. Twenty-three members joined Rep. Smith in calling for the IG investigation including: Rep. Joe Barton (TX-06), Rep. Kevin Brady (TX-08), Rep. Michael Burgess (TX-26), Rep. John Carter (TX-31), Rep. Michael Conaway (TX-11), Rep. John Culberson (TX-07), Rep. Blake Farenthold (TX-27), Rep. Bill Flores (TX-17), Rep. Pete Gallego (TX-23), Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01), Rep. Kay Granger (TX-12), Rep. Ralph Hall (TX-04), Rep. Jeb Hensarling (TX-05), Rep. Sam Johnson (TX-03), Rep. Kenny Marchant (TX-24), Rep. Michael McCaul (TX-10), Rep. Randy Neugebauer (TX-19), Rep. Pete Olson (TX-22), Rep. Ted Poe (TX-02), Rep. Pete Sessions (TX-32), Rep. Mac Thornberry (TX-13), Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14), and Rep. Roger Williams (TX-25). A full copy of the letter can be found here.
05.12.2014	Former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to troubling reports that the Obama administration released more than 36,000 criminal immigrants in 2013, including individuals convicted of murder, rape, kidnapping, and drunk driving. According to a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers released 36,007 criminal illegal immigrants into American communities last year alone. Together these 36,000 criminals had 88,000 convictions, including 193 homicide convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 9,187 dangerous drug convictions, and 16,070 drunk or drugged driving convictions. Congressman Smith: “President Obama’s lax immigration policies have put the lives of Americans at risk. In 2013, ICE officials reportedly released more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. “Obama administration officials want the American people to think these individuals were guilty of minor, petty offenses. But the convictions tell a chilling story. Among those released were criminal immigrants convicted of murder, rape, kidnapping, drunk driving, and aggravated assault. “According to information obtained by the Center for Immigration Studies, the crimes committed by the released immigrants include nearly 200 convictions of homicide, over 400 sexual assault convictions, more than 300 kidnapping convictions, and upwards of 16,000 drunk or drugged driving convictions. “This would be considered the worst prison break in American history, except it was sanctioned by the President and perpetrated by our own immigration officials. These criminal immigrants should have been deported to ensure that they could never commit crimes on U.S. soil. But instead, ICE officials chose not to detain them and instead released them back onto American streets. “The Administration’s actions are outrageous. They willfully and knowingly put the interests of criminal immigrants before the safety and security of the American people. “There should be no discussion of reforming our nation’s immigration laws until the President enforces the laws currently on the books. The safety of the American people should be the President’s top priority. We need a President who follows the law and deports criminal immigrants who violate our laws and endanger our lives.”
05.07.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify regarding the IRS targeting scandal. The House also approved a measure calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate current and former IRS officials for the selective targeting of conservative organizations and individuals. In 2013, the Treasury Department Inspector General (IG) reported IRS officials had targeted conservative individuals and organizations for additional screening based on their political views. According to the IG, nearly 300 conservative groups were targeted for additional scrutiny, while only six liberal groups were singled out. Following a thorough investigation, the House Oversight Committee concluded that Ms. Lerner played a central role in the targeting of conservative organizations for additional scrutiny. The Committee also found that Ms. Lerner failed to meet her legal obligation to answer questions before Congress after she waived her right not to testify at a May 2013 hearing. Rep. Smith: “It is fitting that the House has held former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress given the contempt that some IRS employees have shown for the rights and freedoms of conservative Americans. Targeting organizations or individuals for their political views threatens our democracy. “The actions of Ms. Lerner and other IRS officials were clearly unethical and may have been criminal. Unfortunately, Ms. Lerner’s refusal to cooperate with congressional investigators has made it difficult for Congress to get to the bottom of the scandal. “We need a special prosecutor, independent of the political pressures of the Obama administration, to conduct a thorough investigation. If any IRS officials are found to have broken the law, they must be prosecuted.”
05.02.2014	On Wednesday evening, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) hosted a telephone town meeting with Hill Country constituents from the 21st District of Texas. During the call, Congressman Smith asked several questions about important issues facing our nation, including the impact of Obamacare implementation, illegal immigration, balancing the federal budget and EPA regulations. More than 1,200 constituents from Bandera, Comal, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr and Real Counties participated in the call. Congressman Smith: “It’s important for me to hear from my constituents about their views on issues facing our country. During regular telephone town meetings, I poll listeners on high profile issues that are before Congress. This week’s call with Hill Country residents showed that my constituents remain strongly opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants and are concerned about the negative impact of Obamacare on their friends and family. The poll also found that Hill Country constituents would like to see federal spending cut in order to balance the budget. And an overwhelming 90% of respondents are opposed to the EPA’s use of secret data to justify costly regulations. “I share the views of my constituents. America will be a better, safer and more prosperous nation if Congress will heed their advice. I will continue to support their views and ensure that their voices are heard here in Washington.” Below are the results of this week’s random telephone poll with residents from six Hill Country counties of the 21st District of Texas. 72% of respondents said they or someone they know had been negatively affected by Obamacare. 92% of respondents do not believe the U.S. should legalize 11 million illegal immigrants in the country now. 79% of respondents feel that Congress should reduce federal spending in order to balance the budget. 90% of respondents said that the EPA should not be able to base costly regulations on data that is not make public to Congress or American taxpayers.
05.01.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) calling on them to conduct a full and thorough review of the security risks associated with the Healthcare.gov website. The Committee has held multiple hearings to examine concerns over the security of the Obamacare website. Experts have testified that comprehensive testing is the only way to ensure the security of Americans’ personal information. “The data obtained by Healthcare.gov is one of the largest collections of personal information ever assembled. It links information between seven different federal agencies and state agencies, as well as government contractors, making it a goldmine of Americans’ personally identifiable information,” Chairman Smith wrote. “But in their rush to launch the website, the Obama Administration appears to have cut corners that have put the personal data of millions of Americans at risk. In addition to the website’s initial security failings, many Americans now worry about how the Heartbleed Bug may compound the risk of financial or medical identity theft for those forced by the government to create Healthcare.gov accounts.” In a hearing held shortly after the website’s launch, security experts testified that an accurate, independent and impartial report on the security of Healthcare.gov is needed. GAO is currently conducting an audit of the security and privacy of Healthcare.gov. But it will not include penetration testing, source code analysis, a review of the developer supply chain, or an examination of secure code practices through the software development lifecycle. “The American people deserve a thorough audit of the website to ensure that their personal data, including birth dates, social security numbers and household incomes, is secured,” Smith wrote. “As the primary, non-partisan agency tasked with shedding light on government programs, GAO has a responsibility to conduct a full and thorough review of Healthcare.gov. This is one of the largest undertakings by the federal government in our nation’s history—and the stakes are high to ensure that the website is secure.” The letter requests that GAO expand its review to include more comprehensive analysis of potential security vulnerabilities. To better identify exposure risks, the letter calls on GAO to utilize the expertise of outside security specialists and private sector individuals, organizations, or companies that specialize in technical information security assessments. The full letter can be found here.
05.01.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) in introducing bipartisan legislation that increases oversight of the National Security Agency. The NSA Internal Watchdog Act (H.R. 4533) creates a Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed Inspector General (IG) for the agency, placing a powerful and independent watchdog inside the NSA who will be accountable to Congress and to the American people. The bill helps assure the public that their privacy is protected while maintaining the tools our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep America secure. Rep. Smith: “Our intelligence community has a responsibility not only to protect our national security, but also to respect our civil liberties. This bill enhances the role of the NSA Inspector General and guarantees there is an independent and powerful watchdog that will ensure the activities of the intelligence community are both lawful and Constitutional. Only with meaningful and independent oversight can Americans be assured that their rights and freedoms are not ignored in the name of national security.” Under H.R. 4533, the new NSA IG will be able to: Ensure all NSA programs and activities comply with our laws and Constitution. Recommend new NSA policies to protect our civil rights and civil liberties. Undertake, immediately after Senate confirmation, a comprehensive review of the programs involved in the Snowden leaks, including the NSA’s compliance or non-compliance with FISA court orders. Exercise subpoena power to require contractors and former NSA employees to give testimony in IG investigations, a power that no IG other than the Department of Defense IG currently has. Prevent personal snooping or any other misuses of NSA programs by rogue employees and contractors, such as investigating ex-spouses. Recommend improvements to whistleblower reporting, security clearance and background check procedures. Challenge, through Congress, any attempted prohibition of an IG audit or investigation due to alleged national security grounds.
04.10.2014	The House of Representatives today passed a plan to balance the budget by 2024 without raising taxes. The Path to Prosperity cuts $5.1 trillion in government spending over the next decade and puts America on track toward paying off our national debt. Congressman Smith issued the following statement in support of the plan. Congressman Smith: “Once again, House Republicans have passed a proposal that balances the budget, grows our economy, reins in red tape and reduces government spending. “The Path to Prosperity balances the budget in just ten years. The President’s plan never balances the budget – ever. “The Republican plan balances the budget without raising taxes. The President’s plan includes one trillion in new taxes. “The Republican plan repeals Obamacare and clears the way for patient-centered reforms that we know lower health care costs. It reduces government spending by reforming major entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. “Meanwhile, the President’s plan continues this administration’s reckless spending that is driving America deeper into debt. Under the Obama administration, the national debt has increased more than any previous administration—it now exceeds $17 trillion. No family, no community, no country can sustain that kind of excessive spending. It’s the road to bankruptcy. “The Republican budget proposal is a step in the right direction, but more must be done. We must continue to reduce government spending and spur economic growth to ensure that future generations of Americans are debt free.”
04.01.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith, chair of the Media Fairness Caucus, delivered the following remarks on the House floor regarding Obamacare. Congressman Smith: “Today may be April Fools’ Day, but Americans are not fooled about the damaging effects of Obamacare. “Millions of Americans continue to receive notice that their health insurance plans are being cancelled, while others see their premiums going up. “The Administration has waived or delayed more than 30 provisions of the law. When will they realize the law just will not work? “Articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times tried to cover for the Administration. One headline read, ‘U.S. to extend sign-up period for insurance.’ The other headline states that the Administration is going to ‘allow more time to enroll in health care.’ “What these articles fail to mention is that just two weeks earlier, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before Congress that the deadline was not going to be extended. “Also, it’s been over 130 days since ABC’s Nightline focused on Obamacare and the problems with the law. “The national media should give the American people the facts, not tell them what to think. Only when they have all the facts can Americans make good decisions.”
04.01.2014	Click HERE for a sneak peek of what your taxpayer dollars paid for. Washington, D.C. - The National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded nearly $700,000 to The Civilians, Inc., a Brooklyn, NY theatre company, for a play that is described as “a thrilling and timely production” that is “a highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: how can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us?” Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “This may be April Fool’s Day, but NSF’s misuse of taxpayer dollars is no joke. I support basic research, which can lead to discoveries that change our world, expand our horizons and save lives. But spending taxpayer dollars to fund a climate change musical called The Great Immensity sounds more like an immense waste of taxpayer dollars - money that could have funded higher priority research. All government employees and their agency heads need to remember they are accountable to the American taxpayer who pays their salary and funds their projects. It is not the government's money; it is the people's money.” This is not the only questionable research grant funded by the NSF. For example, the agency awarded $220,000 in taxpayer dollars to study animal photos in National Geographic and nearly $350,000 to analyze early human-set fires in New Zealand. Other questionable grants include: Ancient Icelandic textile industry (A study exploring gender, textiles and society in Iceland from the Viking Age (ca. 874-1050) until the early 19th century), $487,049 Do Turkish women wear veils because they are fashionable?, $199,088 How local Indian politicians can improve their performance, $425,000 Lawsuits in Peru from 1600 - 1700, $50,000 Mayan architecture and the salt industry during the Maya Classic period (250-900 AD), $233,141 The Frontiers in Innovation Research, Science and Technology (FIRST) Act, which the Committee will consider in the coming weeks, prioritizes taxpayer investments in science. Recent reports have pointed to the U.S. falling behind other nations that make targeted investments in research. To remain globally competitive, the FIRST Act ensures priorities are funded and that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. The Act increases transparency and accountability by requiring the NSF to issue summaries of how each grant contributes to the national interest.

03.31.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today commented on the recent report by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) that revealed the Administration is releasing thousands more criminal illegal immigrants back into American communities than they are deporting. Representative Smith: “The Administration often speaks of its so-called historic record deportation numbers. However, a recent report by the Center for Immigration Studies found that Immigration officials released more criminal and illegal immigrants into our communities than they attempted to remove last year. In fact, Immigration and Customs Enforcement only attempted to deport about one-fourth of the illegal immigrants they encountered in 2013. Approximately 68,000 of those encountered by the Administration have criminal convictions on their records. The Administration disregarded the safety and lives of the American people when they released these criminal illegal immigrants back into our neighborhoods. “When the government puts criminal and illegal immigrants back on the street, it can have tragic results. Studies show that these criminal and illegal immigrants are likely to repeat their offenses. In fact, in 2012, the Congressional Research Service determined that over 26,000 criminal and illegal immigrants were re-arrested almost 58,000 times. Their crimes ranged from drug violations to major offenses, such as rape, kidnapping, and murder. “The result of this Administration’s conscious failure to enforce immigration law threatens innocent Americans. If the President cannot be trusted to enforce our current immigration laws, he cannot be trusted to enforce any changes to our immigration policies.”
03.26.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today commented on the Democrats’ filing a discharge petition in an attempt to force a floor vote on their immigration legislation. Representative Smith: “The Democrats’ bill to give amnesty to almost 11 million illegal immigrants is insulting to those who have been playing by the rules and waiting their turn in line. Why should those who have broken our laws be treated better than those who are obeying our laws? “The Democrats are not serious about enacting immigration legislation. If they were, they would agree to secure the border first rather than pass legislation that encourages more illegal immigration.”
03.25.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), who is Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, today released the following statement after EPA released its draft rule defining “Waters of the United States” that the agency can regulate under the Clean Water Act. Congressman Smith: “As expected, the EPA’s proposed water rule expands the agency’s control over natural and man-made streams, lakes, ponds and wetlands. If approved, this rule could allow the EPA to regulate virtually every body of water in the United States. In preparing this proposal, the EPA failed to incorporate adequate peer-reviewed science in accordance with the agency’s own statutory obligations. This could be the largest expansion ever of EPA’s authority to regulate private property. It’s troubling that the Administration proposed this expansion before its independent science advisors have had the chance to complete its review of the underlying science. The Obama administration continues to sidestep scientific integrity in order to fast track an abusive regulatory agenda.”
03.19.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), who is Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, today sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy raising serious concerns about the agency’s scientific advisory processes. The letter highlights potential conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency within EPA’s supposedly independent scientific panel charged with reviewing what could be the most expensive regulation in history. By EPA’s own cost estimate, lowering ozone standards to the range being discussed by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) Ozone Review Panel could cost nearly $100 billion per year. Congressman Smith: “The CASAC Ozone Review Panel appears to violate agency policies designed to ensure balance, independence and impartiality. Due to the substantial economic cost associated with finalizing a more stringent ozone standard, EPA should make every effort to ensure the transparency of the regulatory process. Additional transparency is necessary to assure Congress and the American people that EPA is basing its costly regulatory decisions on the best available science and not a predetermined regulatory agenda. In light of these serious concerns, it is unacceptable for EPA to move forward with new rules without first addressing potential conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency within a panel intended to provide the agency with independent scientific assessments.” Recent testimony before the Committee and the current makeup of the panel reveal a number of problems, including: panelists reviewing their own work; a lack of turnover among CASAC Ozone Review Panel members; and existing financial relationships between panelists and the EPA. Dr. Robert Phalen, a Co-Director of the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory and a former member of the CASAC panel on fine particulate matter, stated in testimony that the current CASAC process “is seriously flawed, it is narrowly focused, and it is even ethically questionable.” The letter requests EPA provide all communications between agency staff, CASAC staff and the CASAC Ozone Review Panel related to potential revisions to the ozone standards. The full letter can be found here.
03.13.2014	The Subcommittee on Research and Technology today approved the Frontiers in Innovation, Research, Science, and Technology (FIRST) Act (H.R. 4186) with bipartisan support. The bill reauthorizes and streamlines federal investments at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by funding research and development (R&D) to address national needs. The bill also sets priorities to drive our nation’s investments in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education programs. The Subcommittee adopted 9 Democratic amendments and favorably reported the bill by voice vote. Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “The FIRST Act keeps America first in areas of science and research that are crucial to economic growth. Our bill focuses taxpayer investments for basic research in critical areas such as biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering and mathematics. Advances in these fields drive innovation, create jobs and keep our economy strong. The FIRST Act also eliminates red tape, accelerates technology transfer and bolsters STEM education. A well-educated and trained STEM workforce promotes our future economic prosperity. But we must encourage our nation’s youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as the FIRST Act moves forward to the full Science Committee for consideration in the coming weeks.” Additional information about the bill can be found HERE. For more information on today’s markup, including amendments and recorded votes, visit the Science, Space, and Technology website.
03.11.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith: "The American people continue to oppose amnesty. And they are putting their Member of Congress on notice. "A Washington Post-ABC national survey released last week shows that 39% of registered voters are less likely and only 27% more likely to vote for a congressional candidate who supports a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally. "There is even less support for amnesty among self-described Independents. 41% are less likely and only 28% more likely to back a candidate for Congress who favors a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. "Considering the media bias in favor of amnesty, these are astounding figures. "And according to the poll, a supermajority of Republicans, 60%, claim that they are less likely to support a candidate who favors amnesty. This stands in stark contrast to the meager 14% of GOP voters who want their candidate to confer citizenship on those here illegally. "We should listen to the voters, not amnesty proponents."
03.10.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (TX-21) introduced the Frontiers in Innovation, Research, Science, and Technology (FIRST) Act (H.R. 4186). The bill reauthorizes and streamlines federal investments at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by funding research and development (R&D) to address national needs. The bill highlights manufacturing competitiveness as the primary role of NIST’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) while providing greater flexibility to MEP centers. It also sets priorities for taxpayer-funded research and drives our nation’s investments in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education programs. The FIRST Act broadens the definition of STEM education to include academic subjects like computer science that build on traditional STEM subjects. The bill also includes language allowing NSF to support student participation in nonprofit competitions, out-of-school activities and field experiences related to STEM. The legislation also encourages outcome-based evaluations of STEM programs. Chairman Smith: “To remain globally competitive, we need to make sure our priorities are funded and that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. The FIRST Act funds innovative science and STEM education programs at NSF. A well-educated and trained STEM workforce will promote our future economic prosperity. But we must persuade our nation’s youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. The FIRST Act encourages NSF to support out of the box learning experiences that will inspire our future scientists and engineers. Unless we act swiftly, American researchers will continue to fall behind in supercomputing and particle physics. And we risk losing our lead in nano-technology, the health sciences, aerospace, lasers and other crucial areas. To reverse this trend, the FIRST Act increases investments for basic research in critical areas such as biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering and mathematics. Advances in these fields drive innovation, create jobs and keep our economy strong. “Unfortunately, NSF has misused taxpayer dollars and funded too many questionable research grants - money that could have gone to higher priorities. For example, how does the federal government justify spending over $220,000 to study animal photos in National Geographic? Or $50,000 to study lawsuits in Peru from 1600 - 1700? We all believe in academic freedom for scientists, but federal research agencies have an obligation to explain to American taxpayers why their money is being used on such research instead of on higher priorities. In a time of constrained federal spending, the FIRST Act protects NSF’s budget in order to keep America on the cutting edge of science.” Last year, the President’s Science Advisor testified that there is “room for improvement” in how the NSF prioritizes research initiatives based on potential value to the national interest. The National Science Foundation spends nearly $7 billion every year. Under the FIRST Act, NSF will be held accountable for grants it awards taxpayer dollars. The bill requires that NSF provide clear justifications for why grants that receive taxpayer dollars are in the national interest. The FIRST Act does not change NSF’s peer review process. It expands accountability and transparency requirements so that only high quality research receives taxpayer funds. The U.S. still leads the world in R&D spending. But despite the U.S. government’s spending more on R&D than any other country, American pre-eminence in several science and technology fields is slipping. Experts have projected the U.S. will fall behind China in R&D spending in about ten years. The FIRST Act encourages federal science agencies to use innovative funding models for research, such as prize competitions and crowd-sourcing, to solve big problems. It also strengthens advanced manufacturing R&D partnerships among universities, national laboratories and businesses. The Subcommittee on Research and Technology is scheduled to markup H.R. 4186 on Thursday March 13, 2014 at 9:00 a.m.
03.06.2014	The House of Representatives today approved an amendment offered by Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to the Electric Security and Affordability Act (H.R. 3826). The amendment assures that EPA standards for all types of new power plants are achievable using existing technology. Chairman Smith: “Economic growth depends on job creators, not federal regulators. We need to increase access to affordable energy, not take energy options off the table. By requiring carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that doesn’t even exist, the EPA’s new power plant proposal effectively bans new coal power. There is no coal power plant anywhere in the world that can meet the EPA’s radical proposal. “What’s equally troubling is that the EPA is planning to require this same, unproven technology for new natural gas power. This amendment stops the EPA’s attack on natural gas. It prevents the EPA from using make-believe technologies when setting standards. Only in Washington can you call something ‘adequately demonstrated’ that doesn’t even exist. This amendment requires the EPA to rely on proven technologies when it sets rules for any new power plant.” Chairman Smith is an original cosponsor of H.R. 3826, which provides direction to the EPA Administrator when establishing emissions standards for greenhouse gases for new power plants. The bill as amended passed the House by a vote of 229- 183.
02.28.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) has been presented with the True Blue Award by the Family Research Council. The True Blue Award honors Members of Congress who have exhibited extraordinary leadership and commitment to the defense of family, faith and freedom.Representative Smith: “Though often overlooked, America was founded on the values of family, faith and freedom. We should continue to promote these values to ensure that America remains that ‘shining city upon a hill.’ I thank the Family Research Council for this award and will continue to promote policies that defend life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as our Founders intended.�?
02.28.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has announced that he has formed the Border Security Caucus in Congress. The Caucus is open to Members of Congress who feel the border must be secured and interior enforcement increased. Representative Smith: “The Government Accountability Office has determined that only 129 miles of a 2000 mile long southern border is under ‘full control.’ That means that only 6.5% of the border is safe from drug smugglers and human traffickers. “Over 40% of those in the country illegally entered as tourists or business visitors and then overstayed their visas and failed to return home. An entry-exit system is needed to deter and detect those individuals. “Almost 12 million people reside in the United States illegally and over 7 million of them work illegally. This situation is costly to American taxpayers and harmful to American workers. “Unfortunately, President Obama has weakened immigration laws through executive orders and administrative actions. “The Border Security Caucus will make border security and interior enforcement a top priority. And that is what the American people want. “A Bloomberg poll showed that 85% of voters want Congress to ‘strengthen border security and create a system to track foreigners entering and leaving the country’ before any other changes are made to our immigration system.”
02.26.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today delivered the below statement at the House Judiciary Committee hearing titled, “Enforcing the President’s Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws.”Representative Smith: “The Obama Administration has ignored laws, failed to enforce laws, undermined laws, and changed laws by executive orders and administrative actions. “These include laws covering health care, immigration, marriage, drugs, and welfare requirements. “Other presidents have issued more executive orders but no president has issued so many broad and expansive executive orders that stretch the Constitution to its breaking point. “As for not enforcing laws, in 2011 the President instructed the Attorney General not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. This Monday, the Attorney General declared that state attorneys general are not obligated to defend laws they believe are discriminatory. “At other times, the President has decided not to enforce immigration laws as they apply to entire categories of individuals. “And the President has decreed a dozen changes to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. “But neither the President nor the Attorney General have the constitutional right to make or change laws themselves – that is what happens in a dictatorship or a totalitarian government. “The President and the Attorney General do have a constitutional obligation to enforce existing laws. If they think a law is unconstitutional, they should wait for the courts to rule. But their opinion is no substitute for due process and judicial review. It is their job to enforce existing laws, whether they personally like them or not. “Ours is a nation of laws, not a nation of random enforcement. To put personal preferences above democratically approved laws reeks of arrogance and conceit, especially when citizens could be penalized or jailed for not following those same laws. Officials violate the Constitution they have sworn to uphold if they ignore laws or counsel others to do so. “All true reform starts with the voice of the people. If American voters rise up and speak loudly enough, they will be heard in the corridors of the White House and in the halls of Congress.”
02.11.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the below statement following tonight’s vote in the House of Representatives to raise the debt limit. Rep. Smith: “Our debt is currently $17.2 trillion and will increase to $26 trillion over the next decade if we continue spending beyond our means. “Raising the debt limit without reducing future spending is the road to insolvency. The debt continues to drag down the economy and increase unemployment. “American families must balance their checkbooks, so should the government. I continue to support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.”
02.10.2014	The House of Representatives today passed the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2431) by a vote of 365 - 21. The bill makes important improvements to the NIDIS drought monitoring program and reauthorizes it through fiscal year 2018. Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) is an original cosponsor of the bill. Rep. Smith: “Recent droughts in Texas and around the country have been severe. And the NIDIS program has helped state and local governments, farmers, ranchers, and others both monitor and predict drought conditions. NIDIS is a good program that has a history of bipartisan support. And it represents the kind of interagency and intergovernmental cooperation that we need to reauthorize in this difficult fiscal environment.” More than one-third of the United States is currently experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. By some estimates, the historic drought in 2012 cost our national economy as much as $70 billion dollars. As a success story, the NIDIS Program currently operates the U.S. Drought Portal (www.drought.gov), a website that features a range of services related to drought, including: historical data on past droughts, current data from weather observations, early warnings about emerging and potential droughts, decision support services for managing droughts, and a forum for stakeholders to discuss drought-related issues. The program is operated through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
02.06.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) who chairs the House Science Committee today co-sponsored the Secret Science Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 4012), a bill to prohibit the EPA from proposing regulations based upon science that is not transparent or not reproducible. The bill was introduced by Environment Subcommittee Chairman David Schweikert (R-Ariz.). Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “Virtually every regulation proposed by the Obama administration has been justified by nontransparent data and unverifiable claims. The American people foot the bill for EPA’s costly regulations, and they have a right to see the underlying science. Costly environmental regulations should be based on publicly available data so that independent scientists can verify the EPA’s claims. The Secret Science Reform Act of 2014, which I sponsored, prohibits EPA from using secret science to justify new regulations.” A 2013 poll from the Institute of Energy Research found that 90 percent of Americans agree that studies and data used to make federal government decisions should be made public. On Tuesday, February 11, at 10:00 a.m. the Environment Subcommittee will hold a hearing, titled “Ensuring Open Science at EPA,” to receive testimony on the legislation. Along with Chairmen Smith and Schweikert, the following Science Committee members are original co-sponsors: Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Paul Broun (R-Ga.), Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.), Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Chairman Emeritus Ralph Hall (R-Texas), Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.), Energy Subcommittee Chairman Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), Vice Chairman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), and Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas).
02.05.2014	The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee today held a hearing to focus on the scientific justification and cumulative impacts of regulations, policies and practices promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and their effects on state sovereignty. The hearing specifically focused on Texas as a case study. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas): “The devastating impact of EPA’s overreach can be felt from state houses to farmhouses across the nation. Americans are tired of the red tape that hampers economic growth. EPA’s regulatory ambitions threaten states’ rights and intrude on the every-day lives of our citizens. State regulators know how to protect the environment within their borders better than federal employees in Washington D.C. Even with the nation’s largest industrial sector, Texas had made vast improvements in air quality. Localized data provides state regulators with the information they need to create effective, targeted air and water quality management. Unfortunately, too many within this administration believe that the only way to protect our environment is through federal government intervention and centralized ownership. We should listen to voices from the states. It’s in everybody’s best interest for agencies like the EPA to help support these state efforts, not hinder them.” From 2000 to 2012, ozone levels in Texas decreased by 23 percent. The rest of the nation averaged an 11 percent decrease in ozone levels. This success was reached through a collaborative effort that included the Texas state legislature, state agencies, local governments, industry and universities. By working together, these groups designed and implemented innovative regulatory controls. Localized data provides state regulators with the information they need to create effective, targeted air and water quality management. The following witnesses testified today:The Honorable Bryan Shaw, Chairman, Texas Commission on Environmental QualityThe Honorable David Porter, Commissioner, Railroad Commission of TexasMr. Kenneth Dierschke, President, Texas Farm BureauDr. Elena Craft, Health Scientist, Environmental Defense FundDr. Bernard Weinstein, Associate Director of the Maguire Energy Institute, Cox School of Business, Southern Methodist University For additional information on today’s hearing, including witness testimony, you can visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
01.29.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in favor of the Agricultural Act of 2014. The House passed the bill by a vote of 251-166.Representative Smith: “Agriculture affects every American. If you eat, you’re involved in agriculture. And 16 million Americans’ jobs depend on agriculture. “I supported the bill for several reasons. The bill provides the most significant reduction to farm policy spending in history and greatly improves agricultural programs. “It consolidates or repeals nearly 100 programs overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture. It saves taxpayers $16 billion in mandatory federal spending, which is a step towards deficit reduction. “The Agricultural Act of 2014 establishes programs that require able-bodied adults to work when they receive food stamps. And this bill ensures that illegal immigrants do not receive benefits. “With substantial savings and key reforms, this five-year bill benefits hardworking American farmers and ranchers and the nation’s consumers.”
01.28.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today responded to the President’s comments during the State of the Union Address. Representative Smith: “Our economy can only grow if we work together to lower taxes, limit burdensome regulations, cut spending and reduce the national debt. Instead, the Obama Administration has pursued a partisan agenda that ignores what’s best for hardworking American families. “This is the wrong time to raise the minimum wage and make it more expensive for employers to hire workers. The economy is still weak and there are three unemployed Americans for every job opening. Let’s focus on getting Americans back to work. “The President’s immigration policies are anti-American since they help non-citizens but hurt U.S. citizens. The President wants to give work permits to millions of illegal immigrants who then will compete with unemployed Americans for scarce jobs. Ten million Americans are unemployed and millions more have given up looking for work –we should put them first.”
01.16.2014	In order to ensure the safety and security of Americans’ personal data, Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called on President Obama to formally certify the safety and security of Healthcare.gov. Chairman Smith: “When the Obama Administration launched Healthcare.gov, Americans were led to believe that the website was safe and secure. As we have learned, this was not the case. If Americans’ information is not secure, then the theft of their identities is inevitable and dangerous. It is obvious that Healthcare.gov is in need of an outside, independent audit. The President should formally certify the safety requirements, security standards and privacy conditions of Healthcare.gov. Given the potential risks and dangers associated with Healthcare.gov today, the President should not let the American people be the next target of cyber criminals.” The Science Committee held a hearing in November that outlined the significant threat to Americans if hackers gained information through Healthcare.gov. Witnesses today outlined the consequences of identity theft. David Kennedy, a “white hat hacker” who testified in November, provided an update to Committee members on his finding. Mr. Kennedy submitted a letter that was signed by seven other security researchers who independently reviewed his analysis of vulnerabilities. According to one of the experts, Mr. Kevin Mitnick, who was once the world’s most wanted hacker, a breach may result in “massive identity theft never seen before.” Mr. Mitnick said, “It's shameful the team that built the Healthcare.gov site implemented minimal, if any, security best practices to mitigate the significant risk of a system compromise.” Several other recent events have raised concerns about the handling of the website. In December, a former senior security expert at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stated that she recommended against launching the Healthcare.gov website on October 1st because of “high risk security concerns.” The data passing through the Healthcare.gov website is one of the largest collections of personal information ever assembled, linking information from seven different federal agencies along with state agencies and government contractors. A recent report by the credit bureau and consumer data tracking service Experian forecasts an increase in data breaches in 2014, particularly in the healthcare industry. The following witnesses testified today before the Subcommittee: Mr. David Kennedy, Chief Executive Officer, TrustedSEC, LLCMr. Waylon Krush, Co-Founder and CEO, Lunarline, Inc.Mr. Michael Gregg, Chief Executive Officer, Superior Solutions, Inc.Dr. Lawrence Ponemon, Chairman and Founder, Ponemon Institute For additional information about the hearing, including witness testimony, visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
01.15.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in favor of the FY 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The House passed the bill by a vote of 359-67. This bill funds the government for the remainder of the 2014 fiscal year and eliminates the threat of another shutdown.Representative Smith: “Under President Obama, the national debt has increased 50% to $6 trillion. We simply cannot sustain that kind of excessive spending. Today’s vote alters the culture of spending in Washington. For the first time in over six decades, spending has now been cut four years in a row and takes spending down to a level below FY09. Congress is finally taking some necessary steps towards deficit reduction. “I supported the Omnibus spending bill for a number of reasons. The bill is $21.4 billion below last year’s spending level. There is no additional funding for Obamacare. “The bill also protects the Department of Defense from $22B in mandatory cuts. These cuts would have endangered our military readiness and national security. San Antonio is home to thousands of brave men and women who serve our country and also to several military installations. The bill fully funds a 1 percent pay raise for our troops and includes a fix to the military retiree pension. The provision ensures that approximately 63,000 medically retired personnel and survivors receive their full annual cost-of-living increase in their pensions.”
01.10.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today co-sponsored H.R. 3811, the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act of 2014, a bill introduced by Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.). The House passed H.R. 3811 by a vote of 291-122. This bill would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to notify individuals, within two business days, of a breach of any security system maintained by a federal or state Obamacare exchange that is known to have resulted in personally identifiable information being stolen or unlawfully accessed.Representative Smith: “Healthcare.gov is one of the largest collections of personal information ever assembled. It links the social security numbers, birth dates, and tax and other financial information of its users. Rather than attempt to protect this information, the Obama Administration placed the privacy and security of Americans on the back burner in its haste to launch the website. “The Administration has a responsibility to ensure that the personal and financial data collected as part of Obamacare is secure. And individuals should be notified when their personally identifiable information has been compromised. Instead, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chose not to notify individuals when a security breach occurs. “The Administration’s constant lack of transparency negatively impacts Americans’ lives. This bill is a step in the right direction, providing individuals the information they need to protect themselves. By alerting users when a security breach occurs on the Obamacare website, they can take action to limit the consequences. “If the Administration won’t protect the privacy and security of Americans, then Congress should. I have created a new feature on my website for my constituents to “Share Your Health Care Experience” so I can be made better aware of the Affordable Care Act’s impact on you and your family. If you would like to share your story, please visit the page, https://lamarsmith.house.gov/share-your-health-care-experience.”
01.09.2014	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today held a Research and Technology Subcommittee hearing to review science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education initiatives developed and conducted by private organizations. Many industry sectors, non-profit organizations, entrepreneurs and educational institutions are working in a variety of ways in order to bolster the STEM related workforce pipeline. Partnerships with education providers, STEM focused competitions, and other opportunities have become important pieces of private sector efforts to strengthen the STEM workforce. For example, in the 21st District of Texas, the organization For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, or “FIRST,” is represented by the Alamo-FIRST Region. FIRST is dedicated to motivating young people’s interest in science and technology. The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) are two programs offered in the Alamo Region. Dozens of local businesses, large and small, support these teams with money and volunteer mentors. San Antonio is home to 67 different FTC and FRC teams and Austin has 40 teams that participate. These students gain an invaluable learning experience without significant federal spending. Chairman Smith: “A well-educated and trained STEM workforce will promote our future economic prosperity. But we must persuade our nation’s youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. We need to learn what is taking place outside of the federal government so we can be sure we are not spending taxpayer dollars on duplicative programs. And we need to more effectively use taxpayers’ dollars to gain the most benefit for our students and our country. You can’t have innovation without advances in technology. The STEM students of today will lead us to the cutting-edge technologies of tomorrow.” The administration’s fiscal year 2014 budget request proposed over $3 billion across more than thirteen different agencies of the federal government for STEM education. Despite this level of federal spending, according to a recent poll, American students rank 26th in math and 21st in science. Witnesses today discussed what is being done by industry to support STEM education. Understanding the work of the private sector in the STEM fields will inform the federal government’s role, help to reduce duplication of effort, and leverage existing programs. The first panel of witnesses today discussed how industry and philanthropic organizations offer financial or technical support for students, professional development opportunities for teachers, and technology for classrooms as a way to encourage interest in and support for STEM education. On the second panel, high school students who benefitted from private sector STEM initiatives discussed their positive experiences and what they learned. The following witnesses testified today before the Subcommittee: Panel I Mr. Dean Kamen, Founder, For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST), Founder and President, DEKA Research & Development CorporationMr. Hadi Partovi, Co-founder and CEO, Code.orgDr. Kemi Jona, Director, Office of STEM Education Partnerships, Research Professor, Learning Sciences and Computer Sciences, Northwestern UniversityDr. Phillip Cornwell, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Panel II Ms. Ellana Crew, 12th Grade, South River High School, Edgewater, MarylandMr. Brian Morris, 12th Grade, Chantilly Academy, Chantilly, VirginiaMr. Daniel Nette, 11th Grade, George Mason High School, Falls Church, VirginiaMr. Vishnu Rachakonda, 12th Grade, Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, Maryland For additional information on today’s hearing, including witness testimony, you can visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
01.02.2014	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today faulted the California Supreme Court ruling that granted an illegal immigrant admission to the California Bar. Representative Smith: “The ruling unravels the fabric of American society by ignoring the distinction between citizens and non-citizens. This is contrary to common sense and the rational application of the rule of law. “The court’s decision follows earlier action by the state legislature and approval by the governor. This makes all three branches of the government in California complicit in the furtherance of unjustified amnesty for illegal immigrants.”
12.20.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) along with Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Paul Broun M.D. (R-Ga.) and Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Larry Bucshon, M.D. (R-Ind.) today sent a letter to the White House, requesting all records of actions surrounding the security of the Healthcare.gov website. The letter, addressed to President Obama’s top advisor for Science and Technology, Dr. John Holdren, outlines a number of security concerns and questions the extent to which those concerns were understood by the administration prior to the website’s launch on October 1, 2013. “In its haste to launch the Healthcare.gov website, it appears the Obama Administration cut corners that leave the site open to hackers and other online criminals,” the lawmakers wrote. “As a result, Americans who have already entered personal information into Healthcare.gov are vulnerable to identity theft.” The data passing through the Healthcare.gov website is one of the largest collections of personal information ever assembled, linking social security numbers, birth dates, tax and other financial information from seven different federal agencies, along with state agencies and government contractors. At a hearing held on November 19, the Science Committee received troubling testimony from online security experts regarding the flaws and vulnerabilities in the Obamacare website that put the personal data of Americans at risk. One witness, Mr. David Kennedy, a so-called ‘white hat hacker,’ gave a demonstration showing how hackers are attempting to access personal information on the website. According to his testimony, not only is the website vulnerable, it is under active attack. Even more troubling, Mr. Kennedy testified that there are “clear indicators that even basic security was not built into the Healthcare.gov website.” Moreover, the administration’s recent efforts to address the flaws with the website’s capacity do not appear to address the larger security and privacy issues raised in our hearing. The letter questions the role of one of President Obama’s top assistants, Mr. Todd Park, in overseeing security issues before the website was launched. The White House has now rejected three invitations for Mr. Park to testify before the House Science Committee, claiming that Mr. Park has not been involved in security issues. However, Mr. Park was a White House co-chair of the official Steering Committee with direct oversight of the security and privacy working groups that oversaw website development. The letter requests that the White House expand on suggestions made by staff that Mr. Park’s activities are protected by Executive Privilege. The letter asks whether the administration intends to invoke such a claim. The letter further states, “It is logical to assume that security and privacy responsibility resides at the highest level of government. We are troubled by the fact that the President either did not know, or did not care, that the personal and financial data collected as part of Obamacare is not secure.” “We already know of numerous attempts to hack into the system and can only assume many more have gone unreported,” the Congressmen wrote. “Unless the Obama Administration takes swift action to address security, it is likely the worst is yet to come.” The full letter can be found here.
12.19.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today co-sponsored H.R. 3789, a bill introduced by Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.). This bill would amend the text of Title IV, Sec 403, of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Representative Smith: “While I do not support every provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act, I felt it is what's best for Americans because it reduces the deficit and helps us get our economic house in order. One provision I did not support was a one percent decrease in cost-of-living adjustments for some military pensions. "To repeal this provision, I have cosponsored H.R. 3789, a bill introduced by Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.). It would exempt all veterans who medically retire, those who receive Combat Related Specialty Pay, and surviving spouses in the Survivor Benefit Program from the cost-of-living change in the Bipartisan Budget Act. "The Bipartisan Budget Act increases defense funding by $33 billion over the next two years. This will help Texas' military installations and protect the jobs of thousands of men and women who serve our country. Without the Bipartisan Budget Act, there would have been automatic cuts in the defense budget that would have eliminated thousands of jobs.” COLA Facts: The Bipartisan Budget Act reduces COLAs by one percent for less than one-fifth of military personnel. All those reaching the age of 62 by 2016 will see no change in their COLA. The COLA adjustment does not affect any VA disability pay.
12.19.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) along with all 20 Republican committee members today sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy highlighting serious problems with the agency’s proposed New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for power plants. Specifically, the Committee members pointed out that any EPA rule requiring the capture of carbon must address where the carbon is stored. Recently, the Work Group charged with reviewing EPA’s major regulatory actions recommended a review of the science underpinning the newest power plant rule. The 88-page recommendation highlighted the fact that EPA rushed ahead with its NSPS proposal without waiting for the advice of the agency’s independent scientists and that the underlying science lacked adequate peer review. However, when these problems were raised, a senior official at EPA deflected the scientists criticisms by claiming that the rule doesn’t need to address carbon dioxide storage. “We are concerned about the agency’s apparent disregard for the concerns of its science advisors,” the lawmakers wrote. “Science is a valuable tool to help policymakers navigate complex issues. However, when inconvenient facts are disregarded or when dissenting voices are muzzled, a frank discussion becomes impossible. The EPA cannot continue to rush ahead with costly regulations without allowing time for a real-world look at the science.” “The claim that the rule doesn’t need to address storage concerns highlights your agency’s continued lack of transparency and consistent attempts to avoid accountability,” the Congressmen wrote. “The EPA’s proposed power plant regulations will put Americans out of work and will make electricity more expensive and less reliable. It is misleading and dangerous for EPA to quietly dismiss inconvenient facts and ignore the consequences of its costly regulations. Americans deserve honesty.” Chairman Smith was joined by the following Republican members in sending today’s letter: Reps. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Paul Broun (R-Ga.), Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.), Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ralph M. Hall (R-Texas), Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.), Frank D. Lucas (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Michael T. McCaul (R-Texas), Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), Bill Posey (R-Fla.), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), Steve Stockman (R-Texas), and Randy Weber (R-Texas) The full letter can be found here.
12.16.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and several lawmakers in submitting an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court challenging EPA’s power to interpret the Clean Air Act (CAA) in a way that bypasses the constitutional role of Congress. The House Science Committee has jurisdiction over science and technology issues related to environmental policy and underlying EPA regulations, including those governing greenhouse gasses. Chairman Smith: “The EPA continually attempts to sidestep Congress and expand its role in advancing a partisan political agenda. Costly and burdensome regulations put American jobs at risk. Disregarding the authority of Congress to set environmental policy undermines the democratic process. The Obama administration continues to overstep its constitutional authority as it attempts to enact job-killing regulations.” The central question under consideration is whether EPA’s setting emissions standards for cars and trucks under the Mobile Source program of the CAA automatically triggers permitting requirements for stationary facilities under other CAA programs. The brief explains that to allow the EPA to re-write the law to suit its regulatory agenda “would, in the words of Judge Kavanaugh, ‘green-light a significant shift in power from the Legislative Branch to the Executive Branch,’ effectively giving the Executive Branch ‘the authority to set economic and social policy as it sees fit.’” The brief states: “Our Constitution reserves the power to enact, amend, or repeal statutes to Congress alone.” Along with Chairman Smith and Sen. McConnell, Amici curiae are Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Reps. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), and Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.). An “amicus brief” is a brief filed in a court by someone who is not a party in the case. Such briefs may supplement the legal arguments made by the parties and can aid the court by bringing to its attention aspects of the case not covered by the parties, such as the impact of the issues in the case on third parties. Oral argument is scheduled for February 24, 2014.
12.13.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) today introduced legislation to protect consumers from unfair taxes on digital goods, like those purchased over the Internet or on a smartphone. The Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2013 (H.R. 3724) ensures that digital goods are not taxed at a higher rate than their tangible counterparts. For example, the bill prevents the taxation of mp3 and software downloads at a higher rate than the tax on music and software CDs. The legislation makes sure that consumers do not suffer tax discrimination because they choose to purchase a good in digital rather than tangible form. Representatives Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), and Howard Coble (R-N.C.) joined in cosponsoring the legislation. Companion legislation was introduced in the Senate earlier this year by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and John Thune (R-S.D.). Chairman Smith: “In our modern economy, more and more consumers are buying digital goods and services rather than tangible goods. While books are still sold in stores across the country, readers can now download hundreds of digital books, newspapers and magazines instantaneously with the click of a mouse from the comfort of their home. But as technology advances, it is important that tax policies do not unfairly penalize consumers who choose to download digital goods rather than purchase their tangible counterparts. This legislation promotes tax fairness and ensures that consumers are not discouraged from purchasing digital goods.” Rep. Cohen: “Digital goods and services are quickly becoming a driving force in our national economy. We need to establish a uniform framework for the taxation of digital goods and services so consumers won’t be double-taxed. Our Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act would accomplish such a goal.”
12.12.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the below statement following today’s House vote on the Bipartisan Budget Act (H.J. Res. 59). The budget passed by a vote of 332-94. Representative Smith: “I supported the congressional budget agreement for a number of reasons. First, it reduces the deficit by $23 billion more over the next 10 years than current law. (Current law is the Budget Control Act known as sequestration.) The budget provides $33 billion more for defense over the next two years, which will help San Antonio’s military installations and the thousands of men and women who serve our country. “The budget also increases the contributions of federal employees to their pension plans and so reduces the cost of federal pensions to American taxpayers. The budget reduces the deficit and helps our military personnel without increasing taxes. “Passing the budget allows Congress and the American people to now focus on the flaws of Obamacare and the President’s dismal record on the deficit. Under President Obama, the national debt has increased 50%--$6 trillion. “It’s going to take a new President and a Republican-controlled Senate to seriously tackle our nation’s debt. Under a Republican-controlled Senate, Congress could overturn Obamacare, enact a real budget that reduces federal spending, and take meaningful steps toward deficit reduction that secure our nation’s financial future.”
12.11.2013	Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to President Obama requesting information about what his administration is doing to address the security risks and privacy concerns surrounding the Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov. Chairman Smith was joined by 21 Committee Republicans in sending the letter. In early December, a top administration official praised the progress that has been made in fixing the website’s accessibility, claiming that the site can now “support intended volumes” of users. However, it appears that the larger security and privacy issues remain unaddressed. In today’s letter, the members expressed concern that in its haste to fix the capacity of the website, the Obama administration has once again ignored glaring security concerns. “While more people may be able to access the site, without much-needed security enhancements, this simply means that more Americans are vulnerable to online criminals and identity theft,” the members wrote. “Mr. President, your Administration has an obligation to ensure that the personal, financial, and account information collected as part of the Affordable Care Act is secure. Unfortunately, in its haste to launch the Healthcare.gov website, it appears that your administration has cut corners that have left the website open to hackers and other online criminals.” According to the members, without adequate security measures, Healthcare.gov essentially becomes a portal for online criminals to access even more sensitive, personal data. The letter requests that the President outline explicit steps that have been taken to improve the security of Healthcare.gov, and asks who within the administration is ultimately responsible for ensuring Americans’ personal information remains secure. At a hearing before the Science Committee on November 19, leading computer security experts from the private sector and academia outlined the significant threats posed to Americans by identity theft. One witness, David Kennedy, is a so-called “white hat hacker” who helps private sector companies secure their websites and data from online criminals. Mr. Kennedy gave a demonstration of real vulnerabilities with Healthcare.gov, showing how hackers are attempting to access personal information via the website. Even more troubling, Mr. Kennedy testified that there are “clear indicators that even basic security was not built into the Healthcare.gov website.” The data passing through the Healthcare.gov website is one of the largest collections of personal information ever assembled, linking information from seven different federal agencies along with state agencies and government contractors. Americans who use the site must input personal contact information, birth dates and social security numbers, as well as income, tax and other financial information. Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was joined by 21 Republican members of the Science Committee in sending today’s letter, including: Reps. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Paul Broun (R-Ga.), Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.), Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Ralph M. Hall (R-Texas), Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.), Frank D. Lucas (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Michael T. McCaul (R-Texas), Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), Bill Posey (R-Fla.), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), Chris Stewart (R-Utah), Steve Stockman (R-Texas), and Randy Weber (R-Texas). The full letter can be found here.
12.03.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy highlighting serious problems that were outlined by the agency’s own independent scientists about the science supporting EPA’s new rule for power plants. The Work Group charged with reviewing EPA’s major regulatory actions recently released a memo that recommends a thorough review of the science underpinning the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) proposal. The memo highlights the fact that EPA rushed ahead with its NSPS proposal without waiting for the advice of the agency’s independent scientists and that the underlying science lacked adequate peer review. Chairman Smith: “The EPA’s regulations must have a sound scientific and technical basis. This principle cannot be compromised. The agency should not act to unilaterally impose regulations on the American people, particularly when its own advisors have expressed reservations regarding the science on which those regulations are based. “Given the massive effect of this rule on the American economy, the agency cannot afford to cut corners. The agency’s stubborn insistence on placing its judgment above that of its science advisors raises serious concerns that the EPA’s rulemaking is based more on partisan politics than sound science. Although EPA lawyers may find creative ways to skirt the law, the American people hold the agency to a higher standard. EPA must quickly correct this problem; the time for excuses has passed.” The full letter can be found here.
11.21.2013	The House of Representatives today approved the Protecting States’ Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act (H.R. 2728) to limit duplicative federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing where the states already have environmental protections in place. The bill, which protects American jobs and promotes American energy production, passed by a vote of 235-187. Included in H.R. 2728 is a provision authored by Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) that ensures the EPA’s ongoing hydraulic fracturing study is based on realistic risk assessments rather than “what ifs” and “worst case” scenarios. In 2011, the EPA initiated a massive, multi-year study into the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. But the EPA’s study has been criticized by the agency’s own science advisors for ignoring the current regulatory process and not producing realistic results. The EPA Hydraulic Fracturing Study Improvement Act, Title II of H.R. 2728, enhances the credibility of the EPA’s work on hydraulic fracturing and our ability to ensure continued safe and responsible production of America’s vast energy resources. The bill was approved by the Science Committee by voice vote in August, and is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Chairman Smith: “Each week, there is more good news about the benefits of the energy revolution underway across America. Whether it’s the manufacturing renaissance spurred by affordable natural gas, or the new opportunities for good-paying energy jobs, the benefits of the shale gas revolution can hardly be overstated. “But some ignore these benefits and only focus on ways to shut down production. In its zeal to regulate, the EPA too often has rushed to link water contamination to hydraulic fracturing. It has made this claim in three high profile cases, only to be forced to retract its statements after the facts came out. “This legislation holds the EPA accountable by requiring the agency to provide context for any identified risks. This will maximize the study’s utility to both scientists and decision-makers. And it will limit the possibility that findings will be misinterpreted or misused by those who are simply looking for an excuse for additional regulation.” More information about H.R. 2728 can be found here. Additional information regarding the Science Committee’s EPA Hydraulic Fracturing Study Improvement Act can be found here.
11.19.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called on President Obama to immediately take down Healthcare.gov in order to ensure the safety and security of the personal data of Americans who have used the Obamacare website. Chairman Smith made the statement following testimony from online security experts at a hearing today before the Science Committee examining flaws and vulnerabilities in the website that put the personal data of Americans at risk. All but one witness at today’s hearing said that they would immediately pull down the site in order to address the security flaws. Chairman Smith: “President Obama has a responsibility to ensure that the personal and financial data collected as part of Obamacare is secure. It is clear that is not the case today. In their haste to launch the Healthcare.gov website, it appears the Obama administration cut corners that leave the site open to hackers and other online criminals. As a result, the personal information that has already been entered into Healthcare.gov is vulnerable to identity thieves. We already know of at least 16 attempts to hack into the system. But we can assume that many more security breaches have not been reported. “Given the testimony we have heard today, there is only one reasonable course of action. Mr. President, take down this website.” The data passing through the Healthcare.gov website is one of the largest collections of personal information ever assembled, linking information from seven different federal agencies along with state agencies and government contractors. In order to gain information on potential healthcare coverage through the website, users must input personal contact information, birth dates and social security numbers as well as financial information. Witnesses today outlined the significant threat posed by identity theft to Americans if hackers gained such information. David Kennedy, a “white hat hacker” who testified today, gave a demonstration of the website’s vulnerabilities showing in real-time that hackers are attempting to access personal information on the website. Not only is the website vulnerable, but it’s under attack. When asked whether he believed the website had already been compromised by hackers, Mr. Kennedy testified that he believed the website has either already been hacked or soon will be. The following witnesses testified today before the Subcommittee: Mr. Morgan Wright, Chief Executive Officer, Crowd Sourced Investigations, LLC Dr. Fred Chang, Bobby B. Lyle Centennial Distinguished Chair in Cyber Security, Southern Methodist University Dr. Avi Rubin, Director, Health and Medical Security Laboratory Technical Director, Information Security Institute, Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Mr. David Kennedy, Chief Executive Officer, TrustedSEC, LLC For additional information about the hearing, including witness testimony, visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
11.15.2013	The House of Representatives today passed the Keep Your Health Plan Act (H.R. 3350) to stop the flood of health care cancellations caused by Obamacare. The bill passed by a vote of 261-157. According to media reports, 4.8 million Americans have received notices that their health insurance policies will be canceled due to Obamacare. H.R. 3350 allows millions of Americans to keep their current health insurance policies. Congressman Smith is a cosponsor of the Keep Your Health Plan Act and voted in favor of the bill. Congressman Smith: “When it comes to Obamacare, the President’s broken promises are piling up. He promised that if you like your plan you can keep it. But for millions of Americans, that’s not true. “He said that the law would make health insurance more affordable. But across the country, Americans are seeing their premiums go up, not down. According to the Heritage Foundation, a 27-year-old individual in Texas will see their health care premiums double due to Obamacare. “And by launching healthcare.gov, the Obama administration sent the message that the website was safe, secure and open for business. We now know that wasn’t true either. “Today, House Republicans voted to hold the President accountable for his broken promises. This legislation allows millions of Americans to keep their current health insurance plans, and ensures that millions more have a choice when it comes to picking health insurance policies. “The President needs to face the facts – Obamacare is unpopular, unworkable and unaffordable. We should replace Obamacare with common-sense solutions that lower costs, expand access to care and eliminate unfair mandates and penalties.”
11.14.2013	The House of Representatives today approved a bill authored by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) to reduce frivolous lawsuits that plague our legal system. Introduced in July, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (H.R. 2655) imposes mandatory sanctions on lawyers who file meritless suits in federal court. The House passed the bill by a vote of 228-195. Congressman Smith: “Lawsuit abuse is common in America because the lawyers who bring these frivolous cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Lawyers can file meritless lawsuits, and defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys’ fees or a settlement out of court. This is legalized extortion. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by imposing mandatory sanctions on attorneys who file worthless lawsuits. “By approving LARA, the House has taken an important step toward improving our legal system and protecting innocent individuals and businesses from facing frivolous suits. I urge the Senate to do the same to ensure that our justice system is not just another tool for those who line their pockets by filing frivolous suits.” Every year, billions of dollars are wasted on these nuisance lawsuits, forcing individuals and businesses to spend thousands of dollars on litigation. This ultimately costs jobs and damages the economy because money that could be spent hiring new employees or investing in new businesses is instead directed toward legal fees. The annual direct cost of American tort litigation exceeds $250 billion. Summary of LARA: The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by penalizing lawyers for filing baseless, meritless and frivolous lawsuits. The bill: Reinstates sanctions for the violation of Rule 11. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was originally intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party. Ensures that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits, including the attorney’s fees and costs incurred by the victim of the frivolous lawsuit. Reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow parties and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims by withdrawing them within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been served. ###
11.14.2013	At a hearing today before the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) pressed EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy about the agency’s continued use of undisclosed data to justify the Obama administration’s billion dollar regulatory agenda. Earlier this year, Chairman Smith issued a subpoena for data used by the EPA to support the agency’s upcoming air quality regulations. This was the Committee’s first subpoena in 21 years. One of the rules purportedly supported by the data – the EPA’s forthcoming ozone standards – is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history, costing an estimated $90 billion annually. In September 2011, then-Assistant Administrator McCarthy committed to make the data sets available to the Science Committee. After two years, one subpoena and countless letters, the EPA has failed to live up to its commitment to provide the Committee with data that could verify the agency’s claims. Chairman Smith expressed concern with the Administration’s reliance on secret data to promulgate rules that affect the American public. He announced his intention to introduce legislation that would strictly prohibit the EPA from continuing to utilize secret science to justify future regulations. Chairman Smith: “The EPA, like every other governmental institution, answers to the American people. Everyone agrees that we need to protect the environment, but we should do so in a way that is open and honest. It appears the EPA bends the law and stretches the science to justify its own objectives. We need to know whether the agency is telling the truth to the American people. The EPA must either make the data public, or commit to no longer using secret science to support its regulations. I will introduce legislation in the next few weeks that will stop the EPA from basing regulations on undisclosed and unverified information.” In addition to the EPA’s use of secret science, members also asked Administrator McCarthy about the EPA’s recent efforts to expand its regulatory reach under the Clean Water Act. A draft rule obtained by the Science Committee is a massive expansion of EPA regulatory authority over private property, giving the agency jurisdiction over almost all man-made and natural streams, lakes and ponds in the U.S. Chairman Smith today raised concerns that such a power grab undermines states’ rights and increases federal control of private property that “could lead to the EPA telling us what to do in our own back yard.” A full copy of Chairman Smith’s remarks at today’s hearing can be found here. For additional information about the hearing, including Administrator McCarthy’s prepared testimony, please visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.
11.12.2013	The Science, Space, and Technology Committee has obtained a copy of a proposed rule to expand the EPA’s authority under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The draft rule redefines “waters of the United States” under the CWA to include all natural and man-made tributary streams, lakes, ponds and wetlands that affect downstream navigable waters. The proposed rule is so broad that it effectively gives the EPA regulatory control over all man-made and natural bodies of water in the U.S., including those on private property. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is scheduled to testify before the Science Committee on Thursday, November 14, at 10:00am ET. Chairman Smith: “The EPA’s draft water rule is a massive power grab of private property across the U.S. This could be the largest expansion of EPA regulatory authority ever. If the draft rule is approved, it would allow the EPA to regulate virtually every body of water in the United States, including private and public lakes, ponds and streams. “The Obama administration’s latest power play to regulate America’s waterways is an unprecedented effort to control the use of private property. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy will testify before the Science Committee this week and the Committee will question her about the Agency’s ever-expanding regulatory agenda.” The EPA is rushing the approval process without thorough peer review of the supporting data. The proposed rule relies heavily on a draft report that has not yet been peer-reviewed or completed. Instead, the EPA submitted the proposed rule to the White House for approval on the same day that it provided the draft scientific assessment to its Science Advisory Board (SAB) for peer review. This is a clear attempt to fast-track the approval process without independent review. Last week, Science Committee Chairman Smith and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Chris Stewart (R-Utah) sent a letter to the White House Office of Management and Budget raising concerns over the EPA’s rushed process to review the rule. The Chairmen urged the White House to allow sufficient time for a full and open scientific peer review of the both the draft rule and the water connectivity report.
11.06.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Chris Stewart (R-Utah) today sent a letter to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) outlining concerns about the process by which the EPA is attempting to expand its jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Last month, Chairmen Smith and Stewart raised concerns that the Obama administration’s rushed process could give EPA unprecedented new authority over seasonal streams and ditches on private property. “Rather than allowing time for a review of their proposed regulations, the EPA is rushing forward regardless of whether the science actually supports the rule,” the Chairmen wrote. “The proposed rule could give the EPA unprecedented power over private property in the U.S. Racing through the approval process without proper peer review and transparency amounts to an EPA power play to regulate America’s waterways. Such unrestrained federal intrusion poses a serious threat to private property rights, state sovereignty and economic growth.” On September 17, the EPA sent a draft rule to OMB seeking interagency review and approval. The proposed rule redefines “waters of the United States” under the CWA and could vastly expand the EPA’s authority over America’s waterways. On the same day, the EPA submitted a draft scientific assessment to its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) for peer review. But according to OMB’s own guidelines, the study must be fully and openly peer reviewed before interagency review of the draft rule. Chairmen Smith and Stewart urged the administration to allow sufficient time for a full and open scientific peer review of the both the draft rule and the study. The full letter can be found here.
10.23.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) in introducing legislation that reduces abusive litigation practices that plague our patent system. The bipartisan Innovation Act (H.R. 3309) builds on reforms that were made last Congress in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which Congressman Smith authored and President Obama signed into law. The Innovation Act addresses the problem of patent trolls, who file frivolous lawsuits based on weak patents in order to force settlements outside of court. Chairman Smith: “Patent trolls engage in legalized extortion by using weak patents and frivolous lawsuits to demand settlements from companies and businesses across the U.S. These patent predators stifle economic growth, leaving companies with less capital to invest, innovate and create jobs. Unfortunately, abusive patent litigation has become big business. According to the Boston University School of Law, patent trolls cost the American economy $80 billion per year. And patent infringement lawsuits have doubled in the last three years—from 2,300 to 4,700. The Innovation Act helps protect innovators and job creators from abusive litigation, while preserving the rights of legitimate patent infringement claims.” Chairman Goodlatte: “Abusive patent litigation is a drag on our economy. Everyone from independent inventors, to start-ups, to mid and large sized businesses face this constant threat. The tens of billions of dollars spent on settlements and litigation expenses associated with abusive patent suits represent truly wasted capital – wasted capital that could have been used to create new jobs, fund R&D, and create new innovations and technologies.The bipartisan Innovation Act is designed to eliminate the abuses of our patent system, discourage frivolous patent litigation and keep U.S. patent laws up to date. These important actions will help fuel the engine of American innovation and creativity, creating new jobs and growing our economy.” Additional original cosponsors of H.R. 3309 include Representatives Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Howard Coble (R-N.C.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Anna Eshoo (D- Calif.), Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.), Tom Marino (R-Pa.), Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), and George Holding (R-N.C.). Key Components of the Innovation Act: Target Abusive Patent Litigation: Targets abusive patent litigation behavior and not specific entities with the goal of preventing individuals from taking advantage of gaps in the system to engage in litigation extortion. It does not attempt to eliminate valid patent litigation. Increases Transparency: Includes heightened pleading standards and transparency provisions. Requiring parties to do a bit of due diligence up front before filing an infringement suit is just plain common sense. It not only reduces litigation expenses, but saves the court’s time and resources. Greater transparency and information is a good thing and it makes our patent system stronger. Modernizes Fee Shifting: Includes a modernized version of Section 285 fee shifting that is fair, clear and will ensure consistent judicial determinations. Provides Greater Clarity: Provides for more clarity surrounding initial discovery, case management, joinder and the common law doctrine of customer stays. The bill works hand-in-hand with the procedures and practices of the Judicial Conference and the courts. Small Business Education: Provides for small business education and outreach by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. More information about H.R. 3309 can be found here.
10.16.2013	Congressman Smith issued the below statement following the vote in the House of Representatives to raise the debt limit. Congressman Smith: “I do not want the U.S. to default on its debt and I do want the federal government reopened to serve the interests of the American people. With today’s vote in the Senate and the House, the government will reopen and pay its bills. But I did not support the legislation because it failed to address our growing national debt and the need to get our economic house in order. “Under President Obama, the national debt has increased 50%--$6 trillion. The federal government now borrows 25 cents on every dollar it spends. No family, no community, no business, no country can sustain that kind of excessive spending. That’s the road to insolvency. It leads to the high unemployment, slack economic growth, and stagnant family incomes we endure today. “Unfortunately, the President and Senate Democrats refuse to address these issues. They refuse to stop their spending spree, despite the devastating impact it has on our nation’s economy. They refuse to discuss any delay to Obamacare, despite clear and convincing evidence that the program is not ready for prime time. They refuse to consider spending bills passed by the House to help get critical government programs back up and running. “It is simply irresponsible for Congress to continue raising the debt limit without implementing any reforms. The solution is simple: stop spending more than we take in. American families and households do this every day. And replace Obamacare with a health care system where the people, not the government, decide what kind of health insurance they need. “The Senate bill funds the federal government until January 15 and extends the debt ceiling to February 7. Unfortunately, this allows Obamacare to be implemented since the bill’s deadline falls after Dec. 31, when individuals and families are required to sign up.”
10.08.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today criticized the Obama administration for allowing an immigration protest on the national mall despite the partial government shutdown. Meanwhile, there have been numerous reports that our nation’s veterans have been prevented from accessing memorials that exist to honor their sacrifice. If the Administration can authorize a national protest, why not also allow America’s veterans to visit our national memorials? Congressman Smith: “I’m surprised that the Obama administration will allow illegal immigrants and amnesty supporters to stage a protest on the national mall, but refuse to allow our nation’s veterans to visit our national memorials. According to media reports, park rangers have been instructed to make life as ‘difficult for people as we can.’ Except the Administration appears to be rolling out the red carpet for illegal immigrants and the President’s supporters. “So illegal immigrants get full access to the national mall for a protest, but our nation’s WWII veterans have to beg and plead to gain access to the WWII memorial that honors their sacrifice for our country. This is just another example of how the Obama administration puts the interests of illegal immigrants ahead of U.S. citizens.”
10.04.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) and House Republicans today voted to make sure that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is fully funded to assist states and communities across the country in the event of an emergency. The House of Representatives also voted to provide funding for low-income women, infants and children to make sure they can continue to receive prenatal vitamins, formula, baby food and other essential items. The House of Representatives will be in session this weekend to continue voting on legislation to restore funding to critical government programs. Earlier this week, the House passed legislation to make sure that our national guardsmen and reserves are paid, and to ensure that America’s veterans have access to the care and benefits they need and deserve. The House also voted to reopen the national parks, including the San Antonio Missions Historical National Park, and to continue federally-funded research for life-threatening diseases like cancer. Congressman Smith: “Once again, House Republicans have voted to restore funding to key government programs during the partial government shutdown. Today, we made sure that FEMA can help states and communities in need of emergency assistance. And we voted to provide women, infants and children with federal assistance so they can get the nutrition and care they need. “These are common-sense bills to fund critical government programs. This is not about Republican policies or Democratic proposals; it’s about what’s best for the American people. I hope that Senate Democrats and the President will set partisan politics aside and bring these critical funding bills to the floor.”
10.03.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) and House Republicans today voted to reinstate federal funding for national parks, including the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. The House also voted to provide funding for the National Institute of Health (NIH) to ensure that there is no disruption to federally-funded research and treatment for cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The Open Our National Parks and Museums Act (H.J. Res. 70) passed by a vote of 252-173 and the Research for Lifesaving Cures Act (H.J. Res. 73) passed by a vote of 254-171. It is now up to Senate Democrats to decide whether they will restore federal funding to national parks and NIH. Congressman Smith: “House Republicans have made clear that we want to work with Senate Democrats and the President to fully restore funding to the federal government. But so far, the President has seemed more willing to negotiate with the leaders of Syria and Iran than with the Speaker of the House. And Senate Democrats slammed the door on negotiations with the House and forced a government shutdown. “These bills are common-sense proposals to provide federal funding for cancer research and to reopen our national parks. The House will continue our efforts to put the federal government back to work. It’s time for the Senate to set partisan politics aside and do the same.”
10.03.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) and House Republicans today voted to make sure that the U.S. National Guard and Reserves are paid during the government shutdown. The House also voted to ensure funding for critical veterans’ programs. Earlier this week, the House of Representatives approved, and the President signed, legislation to provide pay to members of our military. The House has now voted to extend this same relief to America’s National Guard, Reserves, and veterans. Congressman Smith: “House Republicans are working hard to reduce the pain of the government shutdown by reinstating federal funding for critical government programs. Today, the House passed legislation to make sure that our nation’s national guardsmen and reserves are paid during a government shutdown. We also approved legislation to ensure that America’s veterans have access to the care and benefits that they need and deserve. “President Clinton and Congress agreed to support veterans’ programs during the last government shutdown. President Obama and Senate Democrats should do the same. I hope the President and Senate Democrats will set partisan politics aside and help us put the government back to work serving the American people.” Earlier this week, House Republicans approved legislation to reopen the national parks and reinstate federal funding for cancer research at the National Institute of Health. The House is expected to vote on 11 additional critical funding bills later this week. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats and President Obama thus far have refused to take up the funding bills passed by the House.
10.02.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement in response to a new immigration plan proposed by House Democrats that legalizes millions of illegal immigrants. Congressman Smith: “Democrats in Washington are at it again – promoting policies that will put millions of Americans out of work. Senate Democrats and the President refuse to negotiate with House Republicans to find a solution to the government shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of government employees out of work. Now House Democrats are pushing for legislation that would legalize millions of illegal immigrants, increasing competition for scarce jobs and making it harder for U.S. citizens and legal immigrants to find work. “Democrats are putting the interests of illegal immigrants ahead of American workers. That’s not good government and it’s not good for the American people. “Republicans are on the side of hardworking Americans. We want to make sure that our nation’s immigration policies put the interests of Americans first. That means securing the border and fully enforcing our immigration laws. It means attracting and retaining highly-skilled immigrants who contribute to American innovation, and the establishment of an agricultural guest worker program that meets the demands of our food supply. It means ensuring that U.S. employers hire legal workers and that dangerous criminal immigrants are not released into our communities. “These are policies that can improve our immigration system. It’s disappointing that Democrats continue to insist on amnesty for illegal immigrants rather than supporting policies that help the American people.”
09.20.2013	The House of Representatives today approved H.J. Res. 59, a short-term continuing resolution that prevents a government shutdown and funds the government through December 15, 2013. The bill, which passed by a vote of 230-189, maintains current sequestration cuts and fully defunds Obamacare. The House has voted 41 times to defund, delay or repeal all or part of Obamacare. Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) supported the continuing resolution and praised the vote. Congressman Smith: “The House has acted to protect the American people from the onslaught of Obamacare’s new regulations and taxes. It’s time for the Senate to do the same. “When Democrats rammed the health care overhaul through Congress, they said that they had to pass the nearly 1,000 page bill to find out what’s in it. Well, the more the American people find out about Obamacare, the less they like it. “The American people know that Obamacare is unworkable. Even the President has given businesses a one year extension on the employer mandate because of concerns with the provision. But what’s good for businesses should be good for the American people too. “Obamacare is unpopular, unworkable and unaffordable. It’s time to defund and repeal this train wreck of a law and implement real reforms that reduce health care costs for Americans.” Recently released polls underscore the unpopularity of Obamacare. A Pew Research Center/USA Today poll found that 53% of Americans disapprove of Obamacare, compared to only 42% who approve of the law. And a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that 44% of Americans think Obamacare is a bad idea, while only 31% think it’s a good idea. The remaining 25% weren’t sure. Congressman Smith also joined the Texas Republican delegation in the House of Representatives in sending a letter to every member of the U.S. Senate, urging senators to join the House in defunding Obamacare through the continuing resolution.
09.17.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), today released the following statement regarding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) announcement that it will propose a rule on Clean Water Act jurisdiction and solicit public comment on a report on “Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters.”Chairman Smith: “The EPA wants to use this study to justify a massive regulatory power grab under the Clean Water Act. The agency’s own Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) has not yet reviewed the study or EPA’s draft rule to ensure that the science is sound and the data backs up the EPA’s claims. But rather than allow time for independent review with input from Congress and the public, the EPA is rushing forward with a proposed rule that is based on the unverified results of the study. This rushed rulemaking is a clear attempt to use the study to rubber stamp the Obama administration’s pre-determined regulatory agenda.“The study could be used to expand EPA’s control far beyond interstate waters, stripping away the power of states and allowing the EPA to regulate virtually every mud puddle in America. The EPA should slow down, and allow a full and fair review of the study in context by the public and independent scientists. The Committee will closely evaluate the report and the rule in order to ensure that independent, objective and transparent science guides the EPA and the agency’s Science Advisory Board.”
09.11.2013	The House Judiciary Committee today approved a bill introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) to reduce frivolous lawsuits that plague our legal system. The Committee passed the bill by a vote of 17-10. The bill now heads to the floor for a full vote by the House of Representatives.Congressman Smith: “Lawsuit abuse is common in America because the lawyers who bring these frivolous cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Lawyers can file meritless lawsuits, and defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys’ fees or a settlement out of court. This is legalized extortion. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by imposing mandatory sanctions on attorneys who file worthless lawsuits. LARA encourages attorneys to think twice before filing frivolous lawsuits.”Introduced in July, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (H.R. 2655) imposes mandatory sanctions on lawyers who file meritless suits in federal court. Every year, billions of dollars are wasted on these nuisance lawsuits, forcing individuals and businesses to spend thousands of dollars on litigation. This ultimately costs jobs and damages the economy because money that could be spent hiring new employees or investing in new businesses is instead directed toward legal fees. The annual direct cost of American tort litigation exceeds $250 billion.Summary of LARA: The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by penalizing lawyers for filing baseless, meritless and frivolous lawsuits. Specifically, the bill:Reinstates sanctions for the violation of Rule 11. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was originally intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party.Ensures that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits, including the attorney’s fees and costs incurred by the victim of the frivolous lawsuit. Reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow parties and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims by withdrawing them within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been served.A copy of the bill can be found here.
09.11.2013	Last night, Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) hosted a telephone town meeting with Hill Country constituents from the 21st District of Texas. During the call, Congressman Smith asked several questions about important issues facing our nation, including the situation in Syria, illegal immigration, Obamacare and government spending. More than 900 constituents from Bandera, Comal, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr and Real Counties participated in the call.Congressman Smith: “Last night, during a telephone town meeting with constituents of the 21st District of Texas, Hill Country residents made clear what they want Congress to do. Participants answered poll questions about some of the top issues facing America. They overwhelmingly oppose U.S. military action in Syria and do not believe that Congress should legalize the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country today. The vast majority of respondents want to see Obamacare repealed, and even more want to see the federal government balance its budget. “These are the sincerely held views of hard-working, law-abiding, tax-paying, good Americans. I share the views of my constituents. America will be a better, safer and more prosperous nation if Congress will heed their advice. I will continue to support their views and ensure that their voices are heard here in Washington.”Below are the results of last night’s random telephone poll with residents from six Hill Country counties of the 21st District of Texas. 92% of respondents oppose U.S. military action against Syria.94% of respondents do not believe the U.S. should legalize 11 million illegal immigrants in the country now.86% of respondents want to see Obamacare repealed.95% of respondents think the federal government should balance its budget.
09.10.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the below statement after attending a classified briefing on Capitol Hill regarding the situation in Syria.Congressman Smith: “If the House were to vote today on launching military strikes against Syria, I and a majority of Members would vote ‘no.’“Over the last two weeks, I have spoken with hundreds of constituents who are overwhelmingly opposed to a military attack on Syria. I have received over 2,000 emails, letters, and phone calls from constituents and 95% oppose attacking Syria.“I share my constituents' concerns. We should not commit our Armed Forces to an uncertain goal, with few allies, and no friends in another country’s civil war. The President said on August 31 that ‘we cannot resolve the underlying conflict with our military.’ That’s a reason to oppose military action, not endorse it.” Last week, Congressman Smith stated that he was leaning toward a no vote but would wait to attend a classified briefing on the situation in Syria before making a final decision.
08.27.2013	On Thursday, the Justice Department brought two actions against the state of Texas in federal court. The Department sued Texas in order to block the state’s new voter ID law, and it intervened in a redistricting lawsuit claiming that the state’s new maps discriminate against minorities. Earlier this month, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department would take action against Texas despite the Supreme Court decision that found provisions of the Voting Rights Act to unconstitutionally discriminate against the state.Congressman Smith issued the below statement in response to the Justice Department’s actions.Congressman Smith: “The Justice Department is supposed to be free from partisan influence and focused on fairly enforcing federal law. But under this Administration, the Justice Department has become more partisan than ever. This lawsuit is an attempt by the President to reassert political power over the Lone Star State.“Voter fraud undermines the credibility of elections and threatens our democracy. Texas has a right to pass and implement laws that protect the integrity of its elections. “The Texas elections laws that the Administration is attacking are fair and reasonable. It is not discriminatory to require individuals to show a valid ID in order to vote—it is good government. Other states have similar laws that have been upheld by the Supreme Court. Why should Texas be any different?”
08.02.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today joined House Republicans in voting on several bills to stop government abuse at federal agencies, including the IRS. Specifically, the House of Representatives passed legislation to prevent the IRS from implementing any portion of Obamacare. The House approved a bill that allows for the termination of IRS employees who use their official positions for political purposes. And the House supported legislation to impose a moratorium on IRS conferences in light of the Inspector General’s findings that the agency failed to adopt reforms necessary to prevent waste and abuse of taxpayer funds.Congressman Smith: “This is just the beginning of our efforts to restore accountability and responsibility to the IRS. Under the Obama administration, it is clear that the IRS is an agency run amok.“IRS officials abused their authority to discriminate against conservative organizations and subject them to additional scrutiny. The agency wasted taxpayer dollars on lavish ‘training’ conferences, spending nearly $50 million from 2010-2012. Other officials were caught using government credit cards to make personal purchases, including books, dinners and even diet pills. Nearly 5,000 IRS credit cards racked up over $100 million in unauthorized purchases. And these are just a few of the scandals facing the organization.“The actions of the IRS are inexcusable and possibly criminal. The agency and its employees must be held accountable. They are supposed to serve the American people, not take advantage of American taxpayers by abusing their authority. “Today’s vote is a step in the right direction, but we have a long way to go to address the problems at the IRS. We need a special prosecutor to conduct a full, fair and non-partisan investigation into the allegations surrounding the agency. And if federal employees are found to have violated the law, they should not only lose their jobs, they must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
08.02.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today joined House Republicans in voting to rein in federal regulations that burden businesses and stymie economic growth. The House of Representatives passed the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 367) by a vote of 232-183.The bill prevents the federal government from imposing regulations that have an economic impact of $100 million or more without congressional approval. The bill gives the people’s representatives in Congress the authority to vote on costly regulations before they are imposed on the American people. Congressman Smith is an original cosponsor of the REINS Act. Congressman Smith: “The American people today face an onslaught of unnecessary federal regulations from the Obama administration. From Obamacare to the never-ending list of EPA rules, government regulation has become a barrier to economic growth and job creation. In 2012 alone, unnecessary regulation imposed an estimated burden of $1.8 trillion.“The American people want job creation, not more regulations. We need to encourage businesses to expand, not tie them up with red tape. The REINS Act reins in out-of-control federal regulations that burden small businesses and job creators. It ensures that businesses are free to spend more, invest more, and produce more in order to create more jobs for American workers.” In the 112th Congress, as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Smith led the charge against the Obama administration’s overregulation. Under his leadership, the House of Representatives passed six bills to rein in regulations and restore accountability to the regulatory process, including the REINS Act. Key provisions of the REINS Act include the following:· Requires agencies to submit major regulations to Congress for approval.· Guarantees no major regulation becomes effective until Congress approves it.· Guarantees fast up or down votes on major rules—Congress must act within 70 legislative days. · Guarantees that accountability for imposing the heaviest burdens on America’s economy falls where it should—with the people’s elected representatives in Congress.
07.31.2013	At a hearing today on Capitol Hill, Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) discussed the importance of brain science research to help advance technologies and treatments for all Americans, but particularly wounded warriors with serious injuries and neurological disorders. The Research and Technology Subcommittee held a hearing on better understanding the frontiers and challenges of brain science research, including its potential and limitations for curing brain diseases and rehabilitating those with brain-related injuries and disorders. During testimony, Air Force Master Sergeant Joe Deslauriers, Jr. provided members a demonstration of his neuro-prosthetic limb, which allows him to control his hand and arm with just his thoughts. Sensors on his skin detect brain signals from his nerves and use those signals to control his robotic arm and hand [photos]. Master Sergeant Deslauriers served in Iraq and Afghanistan as an Explosive Ordinance Disposal Technician, discovering, disarming and detonating hundreds of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). In September 2011, Master Sergeant lost his left arm and both legs to an IED while helping to evacuate an injured Marine from a danger zone. He was awarded the Silver Star for his valor. Chairman Smith: “Near my district in San Antonio, the Department of Orthopedics & Rehabilitation at Brooke Army Medical Center provides state of the art orthopedic and rehabilitative care to active duty soldiers of all services. I have met with many of these wounded veterans who deserve a better life. “My district is home to several brain rehabilitation centers, including the Texas NeuroRehab Center and Reeves Rehabilitation Center. These centers theat thousands of patients who look forward to leading independent and productive lives. “This is where the National Science Foundation (NSF) can play an important role towards understanding the basic science behind Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, autism, stroke, dementia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and many other debilitating neurological disorders. NSF should support research in this area because the results will have clear and direct benefits to the American people. The results of this research could be the foundation of new technologies that help wounded warriors walk again and also improve the quality of life for many injured Americans.”The Science Committee has jurisdiction over the NSF and helps shape the organization’s research priorities to ensure they are in the best interests of the American people. For more information about today’s hearing, including witness testimony, please visit the Science, Space, and Technology Committee website.Chairman Smith meets with Air Force Master SergeantJoe Deslauriers, Jr., who lost left arm and both legs in anIED explosion in Afghanistan. Chairman Smith tests out a neuro-prosthetic limb.
07.25.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the below statement in response to reports that Attorney General Eric Holder plans to ask a federal court to require Texas to get permission from the Justice Department before election rules and laws can be implemented. Texas, along with several other states, was released from the decades-old pre-clearance rule under the Voting Rights Act after a Supreme Court decision found the rule to be unconstitutional. According to reports, the Justice Department will seek to reinstate the pre-clearance rule against Texas for another ten years. Congressman Smith: “In June, the Supreme Court found that it was unconstitutional to hold Texas and several other states to a different standard in the Voting Rights Act. The Court found that the actions of the past could not be held against current and future generations. The result of the decision is that Texas is no longer required to seek pre-clearance from the Justice Department before voting rights laws can be implemented. “In other words, the Supreme Court message to the Justice Department was clear – don’t mess with Texas. But Eric Holder and the Justice Department aren’t listening. They have decided to continue their vendetta against Texas by asking a federal judge to reinstate the pre-clearance requirement. “Texas has a right to pass and implement laws that protect the integrity of its elections. Citizens are required to show a valid form of identification to open a bank account, drive a car or board a plane. In fact, the Justice Department’s own policy requires visitors to show valid photo ID before being allowed to enter some buildings. It is not discriminatory for Texas to require individuals to show a valid ID in order to vote.”
07.22.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Chris Stewart (R-Utah) today sent a final letter to newly confirmed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy demanding the release of “secret science” that the agency has used as the basis of costly regulations. The Committee has repeatedly requested the data EPA uses to justify virtually every Clean Air Act regulation proposed and finalized by the Obama Administration. “If EPA has nothing to hide, why not provide this information to Congress and the American people?,” Chairmen Smith and Stewart asked. “We are concerned that EPA’s reluctance to respond to Congressional requests or to obtain and assess the data to assure the legitimacy of claimed benefits may reflect weaknesses in the studies…Recent claims by the agency that it is working to obtain the data from certain academic institutions ring hollow, given the years of delay and excuses.”For more than two years, the Committee has sought access to the data, sending six letters to the EPA and other top administration officials. But the administration has refused to substantively respond to the request. The data sets in question are used to justify major costly new air regulations. As one example, the EPA’s proposed limits on ozone are expected to be some of the most costly the federal government has ever issued. In the EPA assessment of this standard, it cited studies based upon these hidden data sets more than a thousand times.“Despite a commitment you made in testimony before this Committee more than 20 months ago [VIDEO], and multiple requests since that time, EPA has failed to provide the information in a manner that would allow for independent scientific verification,” the lawmakers wrote. “Given the central role of these publically-funded analyses in providing justification for major, costly EPA regulations, it is imperative that this information be open and transparent. The American people are going to be forced to foot the bill. They have a right to know whether EPA’s new rules are based on sound science or a partisan agenda.”Chairmen Smith and Stewart gave the EPA one last chance to comply with the request, saying that “failure to provide the requested documents will result in a subpoena to ensure disclosure.” The Chairmen demand EPA provides the data by July 31, 2013 to avoid a subpoena.In July, President Obama gave a speech proclaiming that “for the first time in history, we’ve opened up huge amounts of government data to the American people, and put it on the Internet for free.” In that spirit, this administration should make public the data that underlies these critical taxpayer-funded studies.The full letter can be found HERE.
07.17.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today supported legislation to delay the implementation of Obamacare’s individual mandate for one year. The House of Representatives approved the Fairness for American Families Act (H.R. 2668) by a vote of 251-174. Congressman Smith has joined House Republicans in voting 38 times to repeal all or part of Obamacare. Congressman Smith: “The President has finally realized what the American people have known all along – Obamacare is unworkable. But instead of trying to fix the problem, the President has decided to put off until tomorrow what should be done today. “The administration is giving American businesses a one year extension on the mandate that requires employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees. But President Obama’s bargain is for businesses only, no individuals allowed. What’s good for businesses should be good for the American people, too. “Unfortunately, this means that the burden of Obamacare’s health care mandate now falls squarely on the shoulders of hardworking Americans and their families. This is not fair and it is not right. “Republicans in the House of Representatives today voted to provide individuals with the same one-year extension that the President reserved only for businesses. The President’s plan gives preferential treatment to businesses. But the American people deserve the same relief from the onslaught of new regulations and taxes from Obamacare.” Earlier this month, the Obama administration announced that it will delay the deadline for employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees for one year. But the administration did not provide this same relief to individuals. The House vote sends a clear message that the people’s representatives believe the American people deserve the same relief President Obama promised to big business. The President has threatened to veto the House legislation.
07.11.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced legislation to reduce frivolous lawsuits that plague our legal system. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (H.R. 2655) imposes mandatory sanctions on lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits in federal courts. The bill holds attorneys accountable for lawsuit abuse.Congressman Smith: “Lawsuit abuse is common in America because the lawyers who bring these frivolous cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Lawyers can file meritless lawsuits, and defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys’ fees or a settlement. This is legalized extortion. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by imposing mandatory sanctions on attorneys who file worthless lawsuits. LARA encourages attorneys to think twice before filing frivolous lawsuits.”Summary of LARA: The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by penalizing lawyers for filing baseless, meritless and frivolous lawsuits.

The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act is cosponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Rep. George Holding (R-N.C.), and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). A copy of the House bill can be found here.
06.27.2013	The Senate vote on the Gang of Eight’s immigration bill could come as early as today. Below is a statement from Congressman Smith opposing the bill and urging Senators to vote no on giving amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants.Congressman Smith: “The Senate immigration bill ignores the will of the American people and instead, puts the interests of illegal immigrants and foreign workers first. Two-thirds of the American people want the border secured before other immigration reforms are implemented. But even with the so-called ‘border surge’ amendment, the Senate bill provides legalization to millions of illegal immigrants before the border is secured. And it includes no deadlines for border security measures to be implemented. So it’s legalization now and border security later, if ever. “The majority of Americans want to stop the never ending flood of illegal immigration into our country. But the Senate bill only reduces illegal immigration by 25 percent. Meanwhile, it creates a massive new incentive for more illegal immigration by granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. “Most Americans feel that legalizing millions of illegal immigrants would be a drain on government services. A Heritage Foundation study found that the Senate bill would cost taxpayers $6.3 trillion because over their lifetimes newly legalized immigrants will take more from government benefits than they pay into the programs.“America has the most generous immigration policy in the world, admitting one million legal immigrants each year. Most Americans do not want to increase that number. But the Senate bill doubles the number of legal immigrants admitted annually, meaning more competition for scarce jobs. “The Senate bill simply waves a wand and legalizes 11 million individuals who came to the U.S. illegally, and then claims that it has solved the problem of illegal immigration. But legalization is not a solution; it creates a whole new set of problems. And it sends a clear message to would-be immigrants that it’s better to come to the U.S. illegally and receive the benefits now rather than follow the law and wait in line.“Senators should reject this ill-advised and destructive immigration bill that puts the interests of illegal immigrants before those of hard-working, law-abiding American citizens.”
06.27.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to the Senate’s passage of legislation that gives amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants.Congressman Smith: “The Senate has chosen to put illegal immigrants and foreign workers ahead of the interests of U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. The Senate bill does not secure the border. And it does not support effective interior enforcement of our immigration laws. Instead, it rewards lawbreakers by legalizing millions of illegal immigrants almost immediately. Meanwhile, those who played by the rules and followed the law are forced to continue to wait in line. “America has the most generous immigration system in the world, admitting one million legal immigrants each year. While we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. And we have the right to expect that those who come to the U.S. do so legally. “Amnesty will not stop illegal immigration. As we’ve seen in the past, it only encourages more illegal immigration. Unfortunately, the Senate bill does not fix the problem. By offering amnesty, it only makes matters worse. “The Senate has failed to protect American taxpayers and workers. The House should reject this bill and instead support immigration policies that put the interests of American workers and taxpayers first.”
06.26.2013	The House Judiciary Committee today approved the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 1772) in a vote of 22-9. Sponsored by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the bipartisan bill discourages illegal immigration by ensuring jobs are only made available to those legally authorized to work in the U.S. Specifically, the bill requires employers to check the work eligibility of all future hires though the E-Verify system. The Legal Workforce Act is one of several bills the House Judiciary Committee has approved to help improve our immigration system. Congressman Smith: “Twenty-two million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, seven million people work in the U.S. illegally. These jobs should go to American citizens and legal workers. “The Center for Immigration Studies reports that illegal immigration reduces the wages of American workers by $100 billion each year. The Legal Workforce Act protects wages and preserves scarce jobs for unemployed Americans by requiring employers to use E-Verify. “The E-Verify system is quick and effective, confirming 99.7% of work-eligible employees. This bill reduces illegal immigration by shutting off the jobs magnet that draws millions of illegal workers to the U.S. The nationwide use of E-Verify will help address the flow of illegal immigration by ensuring that employers hire legal workers.”Created in 1996, E-Verify is a web-based program that checks the Social Security numbers or alien identification numbers of new hires against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records to eliminate fraudulent numbers and help ensure that new hires are genuinely eligible to work in the U.S. Today, over 450,000 American employers voluntarily use E-Verify. Outside evaluations have found that the vast majority of employers using E-Verify believe it to be an effective and reliable tool for checking the legal status of their employees. Summary of the Legal Workforce Act: · Repeals I-9 System: Repeals the current paper-based I-9 system and replaces it with a completely electronic work eligibility check, bringing the process into the 21st century.· Gradual Phase-In: Phases-in mandatory E-Verify participation for new hires in six month increments beginning on the date of enactment. Within six months of enactment, businesses having more than 10,000 employees are required to use E-Verify. Within 12 months of enactment, businesses having 500 to 9,999 employees are required to use E-Verify. Eighteen months after enactment, businesses having 20 to 499 employees must use E-Verify. And 24 months after enactment, businesses having 1 to 19 employees must use E-Verify. · Agriculture: Requires that employees performing “agricultural labor or services” are only subject to an E-Verify check within 24 months of the date of enactment. · States as Partners: Preempts duplicative state laws mandating E-Verify use but retains the ability of states and localities to condition business licenses on the requirement that the employer use E-Verify in good faith under the federal law. In addition, the bill allows states to enforce the federal E-Verify requirement and incentivizes them to do so by letting them keep the fines they recover from employers who violate the law. · Protects Against Identity Theft: The bill allows individuals to lock their Social Security number (SSN) so that it can’t be used by another person to get a job. It also allows parents or legal guardians to lock the SSN of their minor child. And if a SSN shows unusual multiple use, the Department of Homeland Security is required to lock the SSN and alert the owner that their personal information may have been compromised. · Safe Harbor: Grants employers a safe harbor from prosecution if they use the E-Verify program in good faith, and through no fault of theirs, receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation.
06.25.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized the Senate immigration bill during remarks on the House floor for ignoring what the majority of Americans want from immigration reform. Congressman Smith: “Two-thirds of the American people want the border secured before other immigration reforms are implemented. The Senate bill ignores them. “Most Americans feel that legalizing millions of illegal workers would take jobs away from U.S. citizens. The Senate bill ignores them. “Most Americans want to stop illegal immigration. The Senate bill only reduces illegal immigration by 25 percent. “Most Americans feel that legalizing millions of illegal immigrants would be a drain on government services. The Senate bill ignores them. “Most Americans don’t want to increase the number of immigrants beyond the very generous one million admitted every year. The Senate bill doubles that number. “Those considering the Senate bill should stop, look and listen to the American people.”
06.25.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s speech at Georgetown University regarding his plan to bypass Congress and move forward with major new energy regulations.Chairman Smith: “I am disappointed the President has once again signaled his intent to move forward with new rules that will make energy more expensive for hardworking American families. Just as House Republicans work to expand our nation’s energy potential, the Obama administration is doing the opposite. The President plans to use executive orders to bypass Congress and create more red tape that will increase the price of electricity and gasoline. And the President’s plan will have little or no impact on climate change. “Affordable, reliable energy is crucial to a thriving economy. And it is only through sustained economic growth that we will be able to make the investments in research and technology necessary to fully understand and properly deal with problems like climate change.”###
06.13.2013	This week, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) hosted two telephone town meetings with constituents from the 21st District of Texas. During the calls, Congressman Smith polled participants about their views on several important issues facing our nation. Around 3,500 constituents from Travis, Blanco and Hays Counties participated in this week’s teletownhalls. Participants are randomly selected registered voters. Congressman Smith: “More than 3,000 of my constituents participated in this week’s meetings about important issues facing our nation. During the calls, a random survey was conducted on immigration and government spending. Here are the results:· 61% of respondents feel that the border should be secured before other immigration reforms take effect. · 78% favor a system that would require employers to hire legal workers.· 72% think the federal government should balance its budget.“These are sincerely held views by hard-working, law-abiding, tax-paying, good Americans. I appreciate the participation of so many constituents and look forward to representing their views on issues before Congress.”
06.12.2013	House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Robert Perciasepe demanding the release of data underpinning costly new air quality rules. On March 4, 2013, Chairman Smith wrote to Gina McCarthy, EPA’s Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation and the President’s nominee to become the next Administrator, requesting the release of underlying data that EPA has relied on to support multiple air regulations. Today’s letter criticizes the fact that EPA has failed to provide the data and continues to rely on it for new regulations even after the National Research Council has cautioned against using them in its 2004 report.“Throughout this process, EPA has responded to our questions in a cavalier manner, hoping perhaps we were not reading the NRC reports carefully or were simply unaware of the law or guidance governing data access,” Chairman Smith wrote. “Current law and OMB guidance are clear in requiring EPA to obtain and release the data. The EPA’s continued refusal to comply with this Committee’s oversight request undermines the credibility of its regulations.” The letter continues, “EPA has projected that its upcoming ozone standard will be the most costly environmental regulation in U.S. history. Working families will bear these costs. They have a right to know what scientific data supports EPA’s claims.” Chairman Smith urged EPA to respond by July 8, 2013 in order to avoid formal Committee action. The full letter can be found HERE.###
06.12.2013	At a press conference today on Capitol Hill, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) joined members of the Immigration Reform Caucus in pushing for legislation to beef up border security and increase interior enforcement of immigration laws. Earlier this month, the members introduced H.R. 2220, the Support More Assets, Resources and Technology on the Border Act (SMART Act), which requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to secure the U.S.-Mexico border within one year. Congressman Smith called on Congress to support the SMART Act to better secure the border and protect American communities. Congressman Smith: “A recent Rasmussen poll found that 55 percent of likely voters favor an immigration plan that secures the border and prevents future illegal immigration. Similarly, a CNN poll found that 88 percent of respondents believe more federal law enforcement officials are needed along the U.S.-Mexico border. And a Fox News survey found that 68% of respondents want new border security measures to be completed before other changes to immigration policies. The SMART Act responds to what the American people have made clear they want: secure the border first.“The SMART Act focuses on the safety and security of Americans by securing the border and enforcing our interior immigration laws. It sets a deadline for securing the border and restores accountability by requiring an annual report by the non-partisan Government Accountability Office on the status of border security. If the border is not secured, the bill triggers the automatic hiring of 1,500 additional Border Patrol agents and the short-term deployment of the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border. “The immigration debate may be complex. But the solution to our nation’s immigration problems is neither complex nor complicated – it’s common sense. We need to enforce the laws currently on the books and secure the border before any other immigration reforms are implemented.” Summary of H.R. 2220: · Requires DHS to achieve operational control of the U.S.-Mexico border within one year of enactment and to submit a report on its achievement to the non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO).· Requires the GAO to submit an annual report to Congress on the state of border security.· Mandates that DHS fully implement the US-VISIT biometric entry-exit system within two years of enactment at all ports of entry in the U.S. · Requires the Defense Department to make 10,000 National Guard troops available for deployment for border control activities on the request of border state governors. · Directs DHS to appoint 1,500 additional Border Patrol agents if operational control is not met.
06.06.2013	Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Paul Broun (R-Ga.) today sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Inspector General (IG) requesting additional information about how his office will conduct an investigation into allegations that EPA disproportionately charged conservative organizations fees for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, while waiving those same fees for environmental groups. A vital establishment of government transparency, FOIA is the law by which the public and media can access information from the federal government that has otherwise not been made available."EPAs actions are cause for concern in light of similar allegations at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the agency is targeting conservative political groups for unfair and improper screening," the lawmakers wrote. "These discriminatory actions reflect an unfair and unequal application of the law, designed to clearly dissuade people and groups of a different political mindset than the administration. Such actions can have a chilling effect on the public, and raise questions about the integrity of critical agencies."In light of these allegations, EPA Acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe requested the IGs office conduct an audit focusing on the agencys use of FOIA fee waivers. In their letter, Chairmen Smith and Broun urge the IG to conduct a swift and thorough audit of such discriminatory practices. As part of the review, they charged the IG to determine "whether these are the actions of a few individuals, or the philosophy of leadership at EPA."The Members also requested that the IG provide the Committee with details about the audit process, expectations for the investigation and the timeframe for when the audit will be concluded.The full letter can be found HERE.
06.06.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee today sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting that he appear before the Committee on June 18, 2013, or some other time before the July 4th recess, to explain the discrepancies between his sworn congressional testimony and his decision to obtain a search warrant for the emails of Fox News chief Washington correspondent James Rosen. According to reports, the search warrant stated that Rosen was at the very least an aider, abettor, and/or co-conspirator of the person who allegedly leaked classified information. Last week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte wrote to the Attorney General asking him to explain these discrepancies to the Committee by June 5, 2013. But the Committee never received an on-the-record response from Attorney General Holder himself answering the questions asked. The Committee did receive a nonresponsive letter from the Attorney Generals subordinate, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, earlier this week. The Committee replied to Kadzik and stated his response was insufficient. Attorney General Holder sent a letter last night but he failed to answer any of the Committees questions. Below is the text of todays letter to Attorney General Holder from Judiciary Committee Republicans. To read the signed letter, click here.Dear Attorney General Holder:We are in receipt of your June 5th letter endorsing the Departments previous letter regarding the veracity of your testimony before the Committee. We are disappointed that your response still fails to fully and adequately answer our questions. Neither the letter from Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, nor your follow-up letter, constitutes a satisfactory on-the-record response by you to the Committee.You testified on May 15th that with regard to potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I have ever been involved, heard of, or would think would be a wise policy. This statement left members of the Committee and the American people with the clear understanding that the Department had never taken the unprecedented step of characterizing a member of the media as a criminal co-conspirator in a sworn court document. We do not believe our request “ that you provide the Committee with an on-the-record explanation of your on-the-record testimony “ is extraordinary. We believe the Committee and the American people deserve to hear from you directly. It is with this goal in mind that we invite you to appear before the Committee on June 18, 2013 at 10:00 a.m. to respond to our inquiry. If this date and time presents a conflict for you, please provide us with an alternative date between June 18 and June 28, 2013, for your appearance.Please reply by COB, Friday, June 14, 2013, to schedule your appearance. We look forward to your reply.
05.23.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) in introducing bipartisan legislation to cut government red tape and restore accountability to the federal regulatory process. The Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 2122), which passed the House of Representatives in the 112th Congress, reforms the current federal rulemaking process to lower the costs and improve the quality of new regulations. Congressman Smith introduced the Regulatory Accountability Act in the 112th Congress and is an original cosponsor of H.R. 2122. Congressman Smith: Under President Obama, the regulatory system has become a barrier to economic growth and job creation. Federal regulations cost our economy $1.75 trillion each year. Employers are concerned about the costs these regulations will impose on their businesses. So they stop hiring, stop spending and start saving for a bill from Big Brother. But rather than burdening businesses with more regulations, we need to free up employers so they can create jobs for American workers. The Regulatory Accountability Act places permanent restrictions on regulatory agencies and restores transparency to the regulatory process. Chairman Goodlatte: Americas job creators are being buried under an avalanche of federal regulations. When small business owners and entrepreneurs have to divert precious resources to manage costly new mandates that are coming down from Washington, they have fewer resources available to grow their business or create jobs and this has a devastating impact on our national economy. If we are to grow our economy and get more Americans back to work, Washington must get out of the way. The Regulatory Accountability Act solves the problem of overreaching and unnecessary regulation by providing greater transparency, cost-benefit analysis of new rules, and a more thorough process for high-impact rules. The Regulatory Accountability Act requires federal agencies to choose the lowest cost rulemaking alternative that meets statutory objectives, improves agency fact-gathering, fact-finding and identification of regulatory alternatives, requires advance notice of proposed major rulemakings to increase public input before costly agency positions are proposed, and fortifies judicial review of new agency regulations. Representatives Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.), Colin Peterson (D-Minn.), William Owens (D-N.Y.), Howard Coble (R-N.C.), and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) also are original cosponsors of H.R. 2122. Companion legislation was introduced today in the U.S. Senate by Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bill Nelson (D- Fla.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Angus King (I-Maine), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Mike Johanns (R-Neb.), and John Cornyn (R-Texas). A copy of the legislation can be found here.
05.16.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) voted today to repeal the Presidents costly and ineffective government takeover of the health care sector. The Republican-led House of Representatives passed H.R. 45 by a vote of 229-195. Congressman Smith, who chairs the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, is a cosponsor of the bill. This is the 37th time the House of Representatives has voted repeal all or some of the failed health care law. Congressman Smith: Three years after its enactment, one thing is clear about Obamacare: the law is a train wreck that will cost Americans trillions of dollars. As we approach the implementation deadline in 2014, President Obamas broken promises are piling up. The President promised that no families making less than $250,000 per year would see their taxes go up as a result of Obamacare. But Obamacare includes 21 new or higher taxes that will cost $1.1 trillion over the next decade. The President promised that families could save $2,500 on health care premiums. Instead, the average family premium has increased by over $3,000 since 2008. The President promised that he would not sign a plan that adds a single dime to the deficit. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, the 10-year estimate for the cost of Obamacare has doubled from $940 billion to $1.88 trillion. Congressional Democrats promised that Obamacare would create 400,000 jobs almost immediately. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, Obamacare will reduce the labor force by 800,000 over the next decade. That means 800,000 jobs will no longer be available for American workers. We now know that the so-called Affordable Care Act is not so affordable after all. Americans across the country are facing higher health insurance premiums, the loss of the health plans, lower wages, and less hiring and business expansion. We should repeal Obamacare and replace it with real reforms that reduce, rather than raise, health care costs for all Americans.
05.15.2013	At a House Judiciary Committee hearing today, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) questioned Attorney General Eric Holder about the Justice Departments investigation into allegations that IRS employees intentionally targeted conservative organizations, including Tea Party-affiliated groups, for additional scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status. Specifically, Congressman Smith asked if the Departments investigation would be limited to the Ohio allegations or if it would be a nationwide investigation that examines allegations of unfair targeting of conservative groups across the nation. In response to Smiths question, Attorney General Holder confirmed that the investigation would be nationwide and not simply limited to the actions of individuals in Ohio. Congressman Smith also asked about what recourse a targeted group might have against the IRS for the possible violation of their First Amendment rights. Specifically, Representative Smith asked if groups might be able to recoup any finances lost while responding to the unfair scrutiny of IRS employees. Congressman Smith: The alleged actions by government employees to target conservative organizations are dangerous, unconstitutional and possibly criminal. Targeting organizations for their political views threatens our democracy and violates the First Amendment of the Constitution. And IRS employees who singled out conservative organizations for additional scrutiny may well have violated criminal laws. I will hold the Attorney General to his word that the Justice Department will conduct a nationwide investigation that follows the facts wherever they lead. If federal employees are found to have violated the law, the Justice Department must prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. And the federal government should also be held responsible for reimbursing conservative organizations for any additional expenses they incurred in responding to the unfair scrutiny of the IRS. In May 2012, Congressman Smith wrote to the IRS about allegations that the San Antonio Tea Party had been subject to delays and burdensome information requests in connection with their applications for tax-exempt status. A copy of the letter can be found HERE. More information about todays hearing, including the webcast, is available at the House Judiciary Committee website.
05.09.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Immigration Subcommittee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) today introduced the Keep Our Communities Safe Act (H.R. 1901) to stop the release of dangerous criminal immigrants into American communities. In the 2001 decision of Zadvydas v. Davis, the Supreme Court ruled that under current law immigrants who had been admitted to the U.S. and then ordered removed could not be detained for more than six months. In the 2005 case of Clark v. Martinez, the Supreme Court expanded its decision in Zadvydas to apply to illegal immigrants. The problem with both of these rulings is that not every criminal immigrant who is ordered removed can be because of the unwillingness of some countries to issue travel documents necessary for repatriation. As a result, the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have had to release thousands of criminal immigrants into our neighborhoods. In the last four years, nearly 17,000 immigrants with orders of removal were released because their own countries refused to take them back. Justice Department officials have stated that these criminal immigrants include rapists, child molesters, murderers, and other dangerous criminals. Congressman Smith: Recent federal court rulings have required the release of dangerous criminal immigrants into our communities, putting American lives at risk. Just because some criminal immigrants cannot be returned to their home country does not mean they should be allowed back on our streets. Dangerous criminal immigrants need to be detained.The Keep Our Communities Safe Act closes the legal loophole that allows dangerous criminal immigrants to be released into our communities. The bill authorizes DHS to detain non-deportable criminal immigrants for more than six months. Congress has a responsibility to make sure the laws of the land protect Americans rather than endanger them. This bill helps ensure that dangerous criminal immigrants do not slip through the cracks of our legal justice system.Chairman Gowdy: In the wake of federal court decisions, our country is forced to let dangerous criminal immigrants back onto our streets if their countries of origin refuse to repatriate them. This law gives DHS the ability to detain criminals beyond six months, through the duration of the removal process, when necessary to protect our communities. The primary function of government is to ensure public safety. Congress should act to fix this judicially created hole in the legal system.Summary of H.R. 1901: The bill provides a statutory basis for DHS to detain as long as necessary specified dangerous criminal immigrants under orders of removal who cannot be removed. It authorizes DHS to detain non-removable immigrants beyond six months, but only if:· the alien will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future;· the alien would have been removed but for the aliens refusal to make all reasonable efforts to comply and cooperate with the Homeland Security Secretarys efforts to remove him;· the alien has a highly contagious disease;· release would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences;· release would threaten national security; or· release would threaten the safety of the community and the alien either is an aggravated felon or has committed a crime of violence. Such aliens may be detained for periods of six months at a time, and the period of detention may be renewed.
05.07.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today delivered the below statement on the House floor regarding the Heritage Foundations study on the cost of amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants. Congressman Smith: A new study by the Heritage Foundation warns that the Senate immigration bill would cost $6.3 trillion. Thats because over their lifetime, illegal immigrants given amnesty would receive $9.4 trillion in government benefits while paying $3.1 trillion in taxes.Government benefits include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and health care. That means each taxpayer would be forced to pay $40,000 to cover just some of the costs of the immigration bill. The immigration bill costs too much, has no deadline to secure the border, and hurts American workers. We should put the interests of American taxpayers and American workers first.
04.26.2013	Last night, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) hosted a tele-townhall with constituents from the 21st District of Texas. Nearly 4,000 constituents from Bandera, Comal, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr and Real Counties participated in the call. During the tele-townhall, Congressman Smith asked several questions about important issues facing our nation. Today, Smith read the results of the poll on the House floor.Congressman Smith: Last night, a random telephone poll of my constituents was conducted in six Hill Country counties of the 21st District of Texas. Here are the results:· 88% of respondents feel that the border should be secured before other immigration reforms take effect.· 84% favor a system that would require employers to hire legal workers.· 96% think the federal government should balance its budget.· 85% believe the American people are taxed too much.These are sincerely held views by hard-worker, law-abiding, tax-paying, good Americans. Congress would do well to heed their advice.
04.26.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 1772), a bipartisan bill that shuts off the jobs magnet that attracts so many illegal immigrants to the United States. The bill expands the E-Verify system and makes it mandatory for all U.S. employers. This will protect American jobs for citizens and legal immigrants. Congressman Smith was joined by 21 members in introducing the bill today.Congressman Smith: "Twenty-two million Americans are still struggling to find full-time employment. Meanwhile, seven million people work in the U.S. illegally. These jobs should go to legal workers. "Illegal workers compete with American workers for jobs and drive down their wages. The nationwide use of E-Verify could increase wages and open up millions of jobs for unemployed and underemployed Americans. E-Verify will help ensure that jobs are reserved for citizens and legal workers. "E-Verify is easy to use and has proved effective at helping employers avoid illegal workers. It takes just a few minutes and immediately confirms 99.7% percent of work-eligible employees."Americans overwhelmingly support making E-Verify mandatory. A 2011 Rasmussen poll found that 82% of likely voters think businesses should be required to use E-Verify. Almost 450,000 American employers voluntarily use E-Verify and an average of 1,600 new businesses sign up each week. Outside evaluations have found that the vast majority of employers using E-Verify believe it to be an effective and reliable tool for checking the legal status of their employees.E-Verify allows employers to electronically verify that newly-hired employees are legally authorized to work in the United States. Specifically, the Social Security numbers of new hires are checked against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records to eliminate fraudulent numbers and ensure that new hires are eligible to work. E-Verify has received overwhelming bipartisan support since its creation as a pilot program in 1996. In 2008, the House passed a stand-alone five-year extension of E-verify by a vote of 407-2. And in 2009, the Senate passed a permanent E-Verify extension by voice vote. Original cosponsors of the Legal Workforce Act include Reps. Goodlatte (R-Va.), Gowdy (R-S.C.), Bishop (R-Utah), Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Burgess (R-Texas), Calvert (R-Calif.), Chaffetz (R-Utah), DeFazio (D-Ore.), Farenthold (R-Texas), Forbes (R-Va.), Franks (R-Ariz.), Holding (R-N.C.), King (R-N.Y.), Labrador (R-Idaho), Lance (R-N.J.), Poe (R-Texas), Royce (R-Calif.), Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), Stivers (R-Ohio), and Westmoreland (R-Ga.).Summary of H.R. 1772· Repeals I-9 System: Repeals the current paper-based I-9 system and replaces it with a completely electronic work eligibility check, bringing the process into the 21st century. · Gradual Phase-In: Phases-in mandatory E-Verify participation for new hires in six month increments beginning on the date of enactment. Within six months of enactment, businesses having more than 10,000 employees are required to use E-Verify. Within 12 months of enactment, businesses having 500 to 9,999 employees are required to use E-Verify. Eighteen months after enactment, businesses having 20 to 499 employees must use E-Verify. And 24 months after enactment, businesses having 1 to 19 employees must use E-Verify. · Agriculture: Requires that employees performing agricultural labor or services are only subject to an E-Verify check within 24 months of the date of enactment. · States as Partners: Preempts duplicative state laws mandating E-Verify use but retains the ability of states and localities to condition business licenses on the requirement that the employer use E-Verify in good faith under federal law. In addition, the bill allows states to enforce the federal E-Verify requirement and incentives them to do so by letting them keep the fines they recover from employers who violate the law.· Protects Against Identity Theft: The bill allows individuals to lock their Social Security number (SSN) so that it cant be used by another person to get a job. It also allows parents or legal guardians to lock the SSN of their minor child. And if a SSN shows unusual multiple use, DHS is required to lock the SSN and alert the owner that their personal information may have been compromised.· Safe Harbor: Grants employers safe harbor from prosecution if they use the E-Verify program in good faith, and through no fault of theirs, receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation. A copy of the legislation can be found here.
04.17.2013	Congressman Smith delivered the below statement on the House floor today criticizing the Senate Gang of Eights immigration proposal, which was introduced late last night.Congressman Smith: "Its hard to believe, but the Senate immigration bill is worse than we thought. Despite assurances, the border is not secured before almost everyone in the country illegally is given amnesty. The bill guarantees there will be a rush across the border to take advantage of massive amnesty."And the Senate proposal offers amnesty to far more illegal immigrants than we thought. In addition to most of the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country, the bill offers to legalize the relatives of illegal immigrants outside the U.S. and even others who have already been deported back home. So current immigration laws are shredded."The Senate bill is bad news for the American people. The good news is that the House Judiciary Committee will come up with a better plan that improves our immigration system and puts the interests of American workers first."
04.16.2013	Congressman Smith issued the below statement today criticizing the Senates amnesty proposal.Congressman Smith: Its three strikes and youre out for the Senates immigration proposal. First, it legalizes almost everyone in the country illegally before the border is secured. This, of course, will encourage even more illegal immigration.Second, it puts the interests of foreign workers ahead of the interests of American workers. The immigration plan allows millions of illegal immigrants to compete with American workers, driving down their wages.And third, it treats illegal immigrants better than those who have played by the rules and waited their turn in line to come to the United States. Illegal immigrants get legal status immediately. The law-abiding”well, they just have to continue waiting.I dont think the American people are going to give the Senate another turn at bat.
04.16.2013	The United States Chamber of Commerce today honored Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) with its annual Spirit of Enterprise award for his support of pro-jobs, pro-growth policies during the second session of the 112th Congress. Congressman Smith: With millions of Americans still unemployed and underemployed, Congress has a responsibility to support policies that encourage the private sector to invest and grow. From reducing burdensome regulations on businesses to simplifying our tax code for hard-working taxpayers, I will continue to sponsor and support legislation that expands our economy and creates jobs for American workers. President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, praised Congressman Smith for his efforts on behalf of American workers and businesses. President Donohue: In the face of high-stakes politics and difficult choices, Congressman Smith provided Americas job creators with a strong voice in Congress. This award recognizes Congressman Smith for consistently demonstrating his support for pro-growth policies. As Chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Smith has sponsored bills to help spur the economy, grow businesses and create jobs for American workers. Congressman Smith maintained a 100% rating with the Chamber of Commerce this year and holds a lifetime 94% rating during his tenure in Congress. A photo from todays award ceremony is attached. # # #
04.15.2013	Congressman Smith delivered the below statement on the House floor today criticizing the Senates amnesty proposal.Congressman Smith: The Senates immigration proposal contains a fatal flaw. It legalizes almost everyone in the country illegally, also known as amnesty, before it secures the border.As a result, the Senate proposal issues an open invitation to enter the country illegally. Millions more will do so before the border is secure. The Senate proposal will dramatically increase illegal immigration. The non-partisan Government Accountability Office found that only six percent of the U.S.-Mexico border is under ˜full control of the Border Patrol. And 40 percent of all illegal immigrants are visa overstayers. Yet the Senate proposal legalizes almost everyone in the country before a system is set up to identify individuals who overstay their visas.The Senate proposal amounts to amnesty first, border security later, if ever. It is fatally flawed.
04.12.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today supported legislation to address the legal chaos surrounding the Presidents unconstitutional recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The Preventing Greater Uncertainty in Labor-Management Relations Act (H.R. 1120) orders the NLRB to cease and desist on all actions that require a full quorum until the entire board is confirmed by the Senate. The Act prevents the Board from implementing, administering or enforcing any decisions finalized on or after January 4, 2012. The bill passed by a vote of 219-209. Congressman Smith: The President should have sought Senate approval of the NLRB appointments. Instead, he disregarded the Constitution and made recess appointments when the Senate was not in recess. Because of his unconstitutional actions, decisions by the NLRB are not only questionable, they are legally unenforceable. This bill was necessary to stop the NLRB from taking action until all members of the Board have been confirmed by the Senate. On January 4, 2012, the White House appointed three individuals to the NLRB using the recess appointment authority to bypass congressional approval of the nominees. But the Senate was not actually in recess, which raised questions about the constitutionality of the White Houses appointments. The Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on certain presidential nominees. In a letter to the Justice Department, then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Smith expressed concern that the appointments would lead to uncertainty over the legality of any actions taken by the NLRB while the appointees remained in their positions. Earlier this year, the appointments were struck down by a federal appellate court in Washington, D.C. In the wake of the decision, legal uncertainly around the Board has increased. The Administration plans to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
03.19.2013	At a hearing today in Washington, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) questioned U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton about the agencys recent release of more than 2,000 illegal immigrants from detention. When asked why the Administration chose to release potentially dangerous detainees rather than reallocating funds from less critical programs, Director Morton could not provide a clear answer. Instead, he continued to blame budget cuts. Congressman Smith issued a statement in response to Director Mortons testimony. Congressman Smith: Todays hearing examined whether the Obama administrations decision to release thousands of illegal immigrant detainees was sound policy or partisan politics. So far, it seems like the decision was politics as usual. ICEs decision to release 2,228 illegal immigrant detainees is a political agenda in search of a justification. Of those released, 159 have been convicted of committing a felony or multiple misdemeanors. This is a clear threat to the safety of Americans and ignores immigration law. The Obama administration would have the American people believe that budget cuts forced the release of these immigrants awaiting deportation. But options exist for the agency to maintain detention space and keep immigrants from being released into our communities. ICE could obtain approval from Congress to reprogram other funds for detention space or use over $100 million available in reserve accounts. The Administrations budget requests the last two years sought less detention space for a reason. The Obama administration has made a conscious decision to not enforce our immigration laws, which puts public safety at risk. More information about the House Judiciary Committee hearing can be found here.
03.14.2013	AUSTIN “ Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) toured the James Webb Space Telescope display at SXSW last week. The full-scale model was on display as part of SXSW interactive. The James Webb Space Telescope is the next generation of space telescopes. It is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is currently scheduled for launch in 2018. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to observe in the infrared, thus farther into space, examining much older stars and galaxies than its predecessors. Photos from the tour are available here. Chairman Smith: "As the world leader in space exploration, America has made great progress for mankind. But our work is not done. We should continue to study, research, and explore space to better understand our universe and better protect our planet. The James Webb Space Telescope is a great example of where our nation can go in the future by maintaining our leadership in the realm of space innovation and exploration -- to galaxies far beyond." Space has been a major story in the national news following the asteroid and meteor events of last month. Asteroid 2012 DA14 passed just 17,000 miles from Earth, less than the distance of a round trip from New York to Sydney. Thanks to the discoveries NASA has made in its short history, we knew about 2012 DA14 for about a year. But the meteor that struck Russia last month was estimated to be 17 meters, and wasnt tracked at all. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee will hold a hearing on March 19 to examine ways to better identify and address asteroids, meteors and other near Earth objects that pose a potential threat to our planet.
03.14.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today spoke at the Conservative Political Action Convention (CPAC) 2013 about bias in the national media and its effect on conservative values in America. Congressman Smith is the founder of the Media Fairness Caucus and chairs the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Congressman Smith: “According to a 2012 Gallup poll, American’s distrust of the media is at an all-time high. Gallup found that 60% of Americans have little or no trust in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately and fairly…When the media don’t report the facts, Americans can’t make good decisions. And if Americans can’t make good decisions, our democracy is at risk. So media bias, to me, is a major threat to our democracy.”Congressman Smith also participated in CPAC’s radio row, and spoke with conservative radio and television hosts from across the country about the serious issues facing our nation. Specifically, he discussed the need to tackle out-of-control government spending and pass a plan to balance the budget. He was interviewed by NRA News about his opposition to the President’s call for gun control and the Senate’s plan to reinstate the assault weapons ban. And he spoke with the Tea Party News Network about how amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants would have a devastating impact on hard-working American taxpayers.Photos from Congressman Smith’s speech and interviews at CPAC can be found here.
03.12.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued a statement in support of the Republican plan to balance the budget by 2023. Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) today released the fiscal year 2014 House budget resolution. More information about the Republican plan to balance the budget can be found here. Congressman Smith: The Republican budget proposal does for the federal government what American families do every day”balances the budget. Hardworking Americans know they cannot spend money they dont have. Unfortunately, the federal government has not been as responsible with taxpayers dollars. The President campaigned on a promise to cut the deficit in half. But under President Obama, the deficit has doubled. The federal government now borrows 40 cents on every dollar it spends. No family, no community, no country can sustain that kind of excessive spending. Its the road to bankruptcy. The national debt is now more than $16 trillion. That number continues to grow with each additional year that we do not balance the budget. The higher our national debt, the heavier the financial burden on American taxpayers. And just like with credit card debt, sooner or later, well have to pay up. That means more taxes on hardworking Americans that stifle economic growth and discourage job creation. If we do not rein in government spending, we are at risk of a financial meltdown similar to what we have seen in some European countries. The federal government needs to set a budget and stick to it. Senate Democrats have not only failed to balance the budget, they havent even passed one in over three and half years. The Republican Path to Prosperity is a roadmap to a strong fiscal future for our nation. It sets priorities for spending and balances the budget in ten years. This legislation helps keep the American Dream alive by ensuring that future generations of Americans are not buried in debt.
03.01.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the following statement about sequestration cuts going into effect. Congressman Smith: I am disappointed that President Obama allowed sequester cuts to take effect. His decision places partisan politics above the best interests of the American people. The cuts are regrettable, but were avoidable. House Republicans twice passed legislation that would have avoided sequestration cuts. The Senate has not passed a single bill to avoid the cuts. And despite the fact that the sequester was the Presidents idea, he hasnt proposed any specific spending cuts to help avert sequestration. Instead, the President demands more tax hikes to continue funding his Administrations spending spree. But the problem isnt that Americans are paying too little in taxes, its that the government spends too much. President Obama campaigned on a promise that he would cut the deficit in half. Instead, he has doubled it. The federal government now borrows 40 cents on every dollar it spends. No family, no community, no country can sustain that kind of excessive spending. It is the road to bankruptcy. Sequestration is a symptom of a much larger problem “ out of control government spending that threatens to bankrupt America. More tax hikes are not the solution. Only serious spending cuts that reduce the national debt will help save our nations fiscal future.
03.01.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined members of the Bexar County congressional delegation in introducing the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park Boundary Expansion Act of 2013 (H.R. 885). Congressman Smith joined Representatives Lloyd Doggett, Joaquin Castro, Henry Cuellar and Pete Gallego in sponsoring the bill, which expands the boundary of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park by approximately 137 acres near Missions San JosÃ©, San Juan, and Espada. This land includes a remnant of the San Juan Dam, the headgate to the San Juan Acequia, and the San JosÃ© Nature Trail to the San Antonio River. Congressman Smith: San Antonio is a wonderful city with a strong military history and rich religious heritage. At the heart of the city's heritage are the five missions founded in 1717, including the Mission of San Antonio de Valero, which we know today as the Alamo. San Antonio Missions National Historical Park is not just a Texas landmark, its a national treasure. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill that helps preserve and enhance the San Antonio missions for residents and visitors. This legislation is important for our culture and community. And Im pleased that members of the San Antonio delegation can once again come together across party lines to support an issue that promotes our city and benefits our constituents. Congressman Doggett: We are strongest when we work together. I am on a mission together with my colleagues to ensure that the Missions National Park receives this long-awaited expansion. You cant overstate the economic and cultural importance of the park to Southside San Antonio. Congressman Castro: This legislation will go a long way to expand and protect the cultural and historical heritage of San Antonio. This proposed expansion will ensure that all of our residents have more access to the missions, and can enjoy these cultural landmarks for generations to come. Congressman Cuellar: The San Antonio missions are a crucial piece of the history of the State of Texas, and we have to make sure that the National Parks Service has the ability to make needed improvements to the park and the ability to expand the areas under its protection. The lands operated by the National Parks Service reflect our nations historical treasures and tell the story of our country, and it is important that Texas history is preserved and included among them. Congressman Gallego: Mission Espada is a treasure to San Antonio and to the 23rd Congressional District. Espada is inextricably tied to the rich culture of our community, and after many years, families still regularly congregate here. Mission Espada serves as a book-end on one part of CD 23, Mission Ysleta in El Paso as the other. I will work with my colleagues so that land surrounding the Mission is added to the designated park land. The Spanish missions in San Antonio are a unique treasure for Texans and Americans. The San Antonio Missions National Historical Park preserves the largest collection of Spanish colonial resources in the country and is an educational, historical and cultural resource for more than one million visitors each year. The park is important to understanding of the history of Texas and the United States, and has a strong economic impact on the City of San Antonio and Bexar County.
02.25.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement on the upcoming sequestration cuts that take effect on March 1.Congressman Smith: The cuts are regrettable but avoidable. House Republicans have twice passed legislation that would have avoided sequestration cuts. The Senate has not passed a single bill to avoid the cuts. Sequestration was the White Houses idea. And yet the President hasnt proposed any specific spending cuts to help avert sequestration. Unfortunately, President Obama appears more focused on playing a sequestration blame game than on preventing spending cuts that would hurt the economy.
02.15.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) today introduced legislation to help stop the growing problem of tax return identity theft. The Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act (H.R. 744) increases penalties for tax return identity thieves to help deter this type of crime and protect victims. According to the Internal Revenue Service, more than 938,664 tax returns and $6.5 billion were associated with fraudulent tax refunds involving identity theft in 2011. Most tax identity theft victims dont even realize what has happened until they file their taxes, only to learn from the IRS that someone else has already filed and claimed their hard earned tax return. Rep. Smith: Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in America. Studies estimate that more than 10 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year. Texans are especially vulnerable to these ID theft schemes. The Lone Star State ranks fifth in the nation for identity theft complaints. Unfortunately, tax season has become high season for ID theft schemes. Each year, millions of hard-working taxpayers expect to receive a federal refund. Rather than collecting their hard-earned cash, many will discover that they have become victims of tax refund identity theft. This bill increases penalties for tax return ID theft to help deter these crimes and better protect law-abiding, taxpaying Americans. Rep. Wasserman Schultz: We have seen countless news stories about how tax refund identity theft is on the rise across the country, particularly in my district in South Florida. Even though the IRS has tripled the number of investigations and doubled the number of staff working on cases in the last year, the number of thieves is also on the rise. Thats why Im holding several town halls in my district over the next two months to help educate constituents on how they can avoid becoming a victim. We also must discourage would-be thieves from perpetuating this crime, which is why Congressman Smith and I have introduced legislation that protects Americans and their tax dollars. H.R. 744 expands the definition of a victim of identity theft to include businesses and charitable organizations, as a growing concern among these groups is having their identities stolen and used in phishing schemes to extract the sensitive information from unsuspecting taxpayers used in identity thefts.
02.12.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the below statement in response to President Obamas continued calls for amnesty. Congressman Smith: If the President was serious about creating jobs and spurring economic growth, amnesty for illegal immigrants would not be on his agenda. The Presidents plan to legalize all those in the U.S. illegally will make it easier for 11 million illegal immigrants to compete with hard-pressed American workers. More than 12 million Americans are looking for work; meanwhile eight million illegal immigrants have jobs in the U.S. Amnesty means fewer jobs for legal immigrants and unemployed Americans. Congressman Smith is the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a current member of the immigration subcommittee.
02.11.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called on President Obama to put the American people first when it comes to his immigration policies. The President is expected to continue his push for amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants during his State of the Union Address tomorrow. Congressman Smith: The President claims that his policies will improve the economy and create jobs. But his rhetoric doesnt match his record. If the President was serious about creating jobs and spurring economic growth, amnesty for illegal immigrants would not be on his agenda. The Presidents plan to legalize all those in the U.S. illegally will make it easier for 11 million illegal immigrants to compete with hard-pressed American workers. That means fewer jobs for legal immigrants and unemployed Americans. American taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for the overwhelming costs of amnesty. Under current law, once 11 million illegal immigrants receive probationary status, they will immediately have access to federal benefits like Social Security and Obamacare coverage. If we thought we had a problem with government spending before, just wait. Illegal immigration is a drain on the economy and amnesty is not the answer. As weve seen in the past, amnesty actually makes matters worse by providing an incentive for more immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally. America already admits one million legal immigrants every year, more than all other countries combined. That generosity should continue. But our immigration policies must put America and Americans first. Unfortunately, the Presidents policies put the interests of foreign citizens ahead of the interests of American citizens and legal immigrants. Congressman Smith is the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a current member of the immigration subcommittee.
02.06.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in favor of legislation that requires President Obama to produce a plan for a balanced budget. The Require a PLAN Act (H.R. 444) directs the President to provide a balanced budget plan to Congress by April 1, 2013. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 253-167. Congressman Smith: The President is required by law to provide Congress with a budget the first Monday in February each year. President Obama has missed this deadline four out of five years in office. Senate Democrats have not passed a budget in four years. Thats irresponsible. Meanwhile, House Republicans have put forward a plan to cut spending, reduce the deficit and balance the budget. Its time for the President to show hardworking American taxpayers how their money is being spent. The federal government now borrows 40 cents on every dollar it spends. Under President Obamas big government policies, the deficit has doubled. No family, no community, no country can sustain that kind of excessive spending. Its the road to bankruptcy. A fundamental responsibility of the government is to set budgets and stick to them. This is necessary not only to keep the country running, but to prevent it from running into the ground. Its time for the President to stop spending and start working with Republicans to save Americas fiscal future. Background on H.R. 444: H.R. 444 requires the President to submit a supplemental budget by April 1, 2013 in the event that the Presidents initial 2014 budget submission does not achieve balance within a fiscal year covered by the initial budget. The bill also requires the President to outline the policies and timeline for achieving a balanced budget.
01.29.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to President Obamas call for amnesty for illegal immigrants. Congressman Smith: The Presidents message to the American people is the wrong one. This Administration ignores what is really broken “ our fiscal future. Our immigration laws arent broken, they just arent enforced. According to the non-partisan Government Accountability Office, the Border Patrol only has control of 44% of the southern border. Thats a failing grade. Meanwhile, worksite enforcement efforts have plummeted, making it easier for illegal immigrants to take scarce jobs from legal workers. Under the Obama administration worksite enforcement is down 70%. Weve been down this road before with politicians promising to enforce the law in return for amnesty. And then after the amnesty, they fail to make good on the enforcement promises. The American people should not be fooled. When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration. Congressman Smith is the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and serves on the immigration subcommittee.
01.28.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to reports about the Senates proposed amnesty for illegal immigrants. Congressman Smith: No one should be surprised that individuals who have supported amnesty in the past still support amnesty. When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration. By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration. Congressman Smith is the former Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and serves on the immigration subcommittee.
01.23.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, today supported a bill that requires the Senate to pass a budget or forfeit their pay. The No Budget, No Pay Act (H.R. 325) passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 285-144. An overwhelming majority of Texas Republicans supported the measure. Chairman Smith: Americans across the nation set budgets for their familys expenses. They accomplish every single day a task that the Senate has neglected for four years. A fundamental responsibility of the government is to set budgets and stick to them. This is necessary not only to keep the country running, but to prevent it from running into the ground. The House of Representatives is willing to give the President and the Senate a final chance. This bill temporarily prevents America from defaulting on our loans. But it makes clear that the Senate must pass a budget in the next three months or suffer the penalty theyre due for their delinquency: no budget, no paycheck. The Senate should tell the American people how they intend to spend their money. Our Founders established a system of government of, by and for the people. Hardworking taxpayers have a right to see how their money is being spent by their government. This bill ensures that Americans receive what they deserve “ a full accounting of how their taxpayer dollars are being spent. Background: H.R. 325 makes clear that there will be no long-term increase to the debt limit unless there is a long-term plan to deal with the fiscal crisis facing our nation. The Senate has not passed a budget in more than 1,365 days. This bill requires the Senate to pass a budget by April 15, 2013 or forfeit their pay. Specifically, the bill states that if either chamber of Congress fails to pass a budget by the expressed date, its respective members will have their pay held in escrow until that chamber passes a budget or the last day of the 113th Congress, whichever comes first.
01.16.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, issued the following statement in response to the Presidents proposal for gun restrictions. Chairman Smith: Since our nations founding, Americans have had the freedom and right to bear arms. As a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I do not believe that limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens will prevent future acts of violence. Unfortunately, some in Washington want to use the recent tragedy for a partisan agenda to enact gun control. But rather than curbing constitutional rights, the President should focus on the underlying causes of these acts, including addressing mental illness and violence in the media. Millions of law-abiding Americans should not be penalized for the actions of others. I will oppose efforts by the Obama administration to restrict the constitutional rights of lawful gun owners.
01.15.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, issued the following statement regarding this evenings vote on H.R. 152, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. Chairman Smith: Under President Obama, the federal government now borrows 42 cents for every dollar it spends. No family, no community, no business and no country can sustain that kind of excessive spending. That is the road to insolvency. While I sympathize with the victims of Hurricane Sandy, Congress has already authorized $9.7 billion in emergency funding. But the $50 billion bill considered today includes additional spending far beyond emergency funds for Hurricane Sandy victims. Emergency spending bills should not be a vehicle for pet projects or even important programs. Those types of spending requests should be considered separately. Congress should wait and see how the already allocated $9.7 billion is spent before going back to the American taxpayers for additional funds."
01.01.2013	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted to avoid the fiscal cliff and protect millions of Americans from the largest tax hike in American history. Smith supported the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Senate Amendment to H.R. 8), which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 257-167. The bill prevents automatic tax hikes on taxpayers making less than $400,000 (single) and $450,000 (married). Without this legislation, residents of the 21st District of Texas would have seen an average increase per tax return of over $5,000. Congressman Smith: House Republicans have passed numerous bills to cut government spending and prevent a massive tax hike on middle class Americans. Unfortunately, the President and Senate Democrats have consistently rejected the House proposals, pushing instead for tax increases that would burden small businesses and stifle job creation. The Senate proposal is not perfect, but it prevents the President from imposing the largest tax increase in history on the American people. The bill provides permanent income tax relief to 99% of American taxpayers. If the bill had been defeated, taxes would have increased for every American. Income taxes, the inheritance tax, and the capital gains tax all would have gone up. With the Obama Administration and Democrats pushing for higher taxes, this legislation is our best hope of preventing tax hikes that would stifle economic growth and job creation. Background on Senate Amendment to H.R. 8: The bill protects tens of thousands of farmers, ranchers and family businesses by permanently providing death tax relief for estates valued at less than $5 million. Without this bill, the tax rate would revert back to 55% on estates valued at $1 million or more. The bill provides a permanent fix to the alternative minimum tax to ensure that nearly 30 million middle class Americans are not forced to pay an additional tax. And it permanently extends the current 15% rate for capital gains for taxpayers making less than $400,000 (single) and $450,000 (married).

12.11.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith today delivered remarks on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives congratulating Kerrvilles-own Johnny Manziel on winning the Heisman trophy. Congressman Smith: Last weekend, America watched as Kerrville, Texas own star quarterback received College Footballs most prestigious award “ the Heisman trophy. Johnny Manziel, the Tivy High School graduate and current Texas A&M University quarterback, became the first college freshman to follow in the footsteps of some of the sports greatest athletes. At 20 years old, hes set yet another new record. The champion who Americans have now been introduced to is the same humble young man that Kerrville, Texas, has known all along. Hard work, determination and graciousness have been Johnny Manziels trademark all along. From the halls of Congress, and from the heart of Texas District 21, congratulations, Johnny, on a well-deserved award.
12.07.2012	President Obama today signed into law the Child Protection Act of 2012 (H.R. 6063), a bipartisan, bicameral bill authored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) to better protect children from sexual predators. Chairman Smith, along with other supporters of the bill, joined the President at a signing ceremony at the White House. H.R. 6063 provides law enforcement officials with additional resources to combat the growing threat of child pornography and online exploitation of children. In August, the House passed the bill by voice vote. The Senate passed Smiths bill by unanimous consent last month with the help of Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). Chairman Smith: Internet child pornography may be the fastest growing crime in America, increasing an average of 150% per year. According to recent estimates, there are as many as 100,000 fugitive sex offenders in the U.S. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reports that Texas has the second largest number of registered sex offenders nationwide. We must do more to protect the most innocent among us”our children. I introduced the Child Protection Act to combat crimes against our children. The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent and today the President signed it into law. This bipartisan bill increases penalties for child pornography offenses that involve young children and strengthens protections for child witnesses and victims. At a time when Washington is known for partisanship, it is reassuring to see bipartisan legislation enacted. When it comes to protecting our children, there are no Republicans and no Democrats, only concerned citizens. Background on the Child Protection Act: H.R. 6063 increases the maximum penalties from 10 to 20 years for child pornography offenses that involve prepubescent children or children under the age of 12. The bill allows a federal court to issue a protective order if it determines that a child victim or witness is being harassed or intimidated and imposes criminal penalties for violation of a protective order. It gives the U.S. Marshals limited subpoena authority to locate and apprehend fugitive sex offenders. The Child Protection Act also reauthorizes for five years the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Forces, a national network of investigators who have arrested more than 30,000 individuals involved in child exploitation since 1998. Chairman Smith and Rep. Wasserman Schultz introduced the Child Protection Act in June. When he became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2011, Chairman Smith named enacting legislation to better protect children from online predators as a top priority. H.R. 6063 is one of the most significant bipartisan bills to be enacted this year.
12.06.2012	Congressman Smith: Americans should not be forced to choose between higher tax rates or devastating cuts to our nation's defense and domestic programs in order to address our national deficit. Republicans have offered to work with President Obama to seek a solution that prevents tax hikes, protects jobs and averts the fiscal cliff." Rather than increase the tax rate, we should focus on tax reforms that close loopholes and narrow deductions." Congress and the President have four weeks to get this done. I urge the President to work with us to find a solution that saves small businesses, protects our military from devastating cuts, and prevents a tax hike on the American people.
11.28.2012	Congressional Republicans today selected Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to chair the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology in the next Congress, which begins in January. Congressman Smith has been a member of the Science Committee since he was first elected. He serves as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in the current Congress. Chairman Smith: As Chairman of the Science Committee, I will be an advocate for Americas innovators by promoting legislation that encourages scientific discoveries, space exploration, and the application of new technologies to expand our economy and create jobs for American workers. Over 80% of the Committees $39 billion budget touches on research and development. We cant have innovation without research and development. And the purpose of the Science Committee is to encourage the R&D that leads to new innovations. The Science Committee can play an exciting part in the discoveries of science, the exploration of space and the development of new technologies. I appreciate the confidence of my colleagues and look forward to chairing the Committee next Congress. House Speaker John Boehner supported Smiths appointment. Speaker Boehner: Throughout his tenure on the House Judiciary Committee, Lamar has been a strong leader on important issues facing the American people. He is dedicated to promoting economic growth to help put Americans back to work, encouraging innovation and promoting national security. I am confident that he will bring the same strong leadership and work ethic to the Science Committee as Chairman, and I look forward to working with him in the 113th Congress. Established in 1958, the Science, Space and Technology Committee has jurisdiction over all non-defense federal scientific research and development. Specifically, the Committee has partial or complete jurisdiction over the following federal agencies: NASA, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, FEMA, the U.S. Fire Administration, and United States Geological Survey, among others. The Committee has five subcommittees “ the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education, the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, and the Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation.
11.27.2012	The U.S. Senate has approved legislation sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to better protect children from sexual predators. The Child Protection Act (H.R. 6063) provides law enforcement officials with additional resources to combat the growing threat of child pornography and online exploitation of children. The House of Representatives passed Smiths bill by voice vote in August. Last night, the Senate approved Smiths bill by unanimous consent. The bill now goes to the Presidents desk for signature. Chairman Smith: Internet child pornography may be the fastest growing crime in America, increasing an average of 150% per year. According to recent estimates, there are as many as 100,000 fugitive sex offenders in the U.S. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reports that Texas has the second largest number of registered sex offenders nationwide. We must do more to protect the most innocent among us”our children. This bipartisan bill increases penalties for child pornography offenses that involve young children and strengthens protections for child witnesses and victims. The Child Protection Act ensures that paperwork does not stand in the way of the apprehension of dangerous criminals. I urge the President to sign this legislation and help better protect Americas children from sexual predators. Background on the Child Protection Act: The bill increases the maximum penalties from 10 to 20 years for child pornography offenses that involve prepubescent children or children under the age of 12. The bill allows a federal court to issue a protective order if it determines that a child victim or witness is being harassed or intimidated and imposes criminal penalties for violation of a protective order.

10.31.2012	San Antonio, TX ” Congressmen Lamar Smith (TX-21) and Henry Cuellar (TX-28), along with University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) President Dr. Lou Agnese, today announced that the Economic Development Administration (EDA) has awarded the University of the Incarnate Word a $1 million federal grant for specialized optometric equipment to be used at the new UIW Eye Care and Health Institute in San Antonios Eastside. The public facility will increase access to health care for residents of the inner city by providing professional eye care services to the community. UIW will construct a three-story, 30,000 square-foot clinic that will serve 25,000 patients yearly. When fully operational, the clinic will create and sustain an estimated 40 to 50 new jobs. Congressman Smith: The new Eastside eye clinic will provide professional care to an underserved community in San Antonio and create jobs for medical professionals in the area. Vision problems make it harder for kids to learn in school and eye infections, if left untreated, can lead to permanent vision loss. The clinic will help San Antonio residents get much-needed eye care regardless of their ability to pay. And this federal grant will ensure that the doors to the clinic open sooner and residents have access to eye care faster. Congressman Cuellar: With just one private optometrist available to serve the Eastside of San Antonio, this clinic will not only provide necessary medical treatment to San Antonians, it will also give an opportunity for students to complete their medical practice requirements. The grant is helping to alleviate eleven percent of the total project cost “ bringing taxpayer dollars back home for a project that is centered on serving the community. Dr. Agnese: There is a significant need for this facility in this part of San Antonio. Some of the diseases that can destroy vision such as diabetes and glaucoma are over-represented in areas like the Eastside. So were very appreciative of the efforts of Congressmen Cuellar and Smith in making this critically-needed clinic a reality for San Antonio. Patients will be served by licensed eye care doctors and interns from UIWs Rosenberg School of Optometry. In addition, UIW will partner with St. Philip's College to assist in training students and increasing the number of nearby residents qualified to serve as ophthalmic technicians. Future doctors will also be able to train at the clinic and an estimated one-fourth of the 65 graduates yearly will remain in the area to practice.
09.25.2012	A local area veteran was formally awarded the Chevalier de la Legion dHonneur at an event in Paris yesterday for his service to the French people during World War II. U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Robert E. Kelso received the award for his personal contribution as a member of the U.S. Army in the liberation of France during World War II. The Legion of Honor was created by Napoleon in 1802 to acknowledge service rendered to France by persons of great merit. Lt. Colonel Kelso, 82, is believed to be the youngest living American veteran of World War II. He was drafted into the U.S. Army at age 13 in 1944 because of a mistake on his draft board records. Despite his young age, he convinced his mother to let him serve his country. He went on to fight in Europe with an armored field artillery battalion. He was wounded in battle and became the youngest American soldier serving in Europe to receive the Purple Heart during World War II. Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today congratulated Lt. Colonel Kelso for the honor and thanked him for his service to America. Congressman Smith: Lt. Colonel Kelsos extraordinary courage at such a young age is a reminder of why his generation is often called the Greatest Generation. Lt. Colonel Kelso served his country with distinction. But he also served the citizens of France by helping to liberate them from the Nazi regime. This medal is a small token of gratitude that represents the tremendous sacrifice made by hundreds of thousands of Americans to free Europe from Nazi rule. I congratulate Lt. Colonel Kelso for this award and thank him for his service to America and to all mankind. Congressman Smith worked with the French Embassy in Washington, D.C. to help arrange the award ceremony in Paris, France. The event took place at Les Invalides, a complex of buildings containing museums and monuments related to the military history of France, as well as a hospital and retirement home for war veterans.
09.20.2012	Leading up to the House of Representatives floor vote on the STEM Jobs Act (H.R. 6429), support for the legislation among national associations, U.S. employers, and trade and professional organizations continues to grow. The STEM Jobs Act boosts job creation and spurs economic growth by eliminating the diversity visa lottery and reallocating up to 55,000 green cards a year to the top foreign graduates of U.S. universities with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The bill is sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and currently has 60 cosponsors. Below are some of the many statements of support for the STEM Jobs Act. Ed Loya, Dell, Inc. Vice President for Global Human Resources: The U.S. has massive economic growth opportunities in the STEM fields. However, having a competitive, global economy means the United States must allow the best and the brightest STEM graduates from American institutions of higher education to live and work here, contribute to our economy, and add value to companies. Chairman Lamar Smiths ˜STEM Jobs Act goes a long way to helping companies compete and grow in the U.S. Drew Scheberle, Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, Sr. Vice President: Austins economy will benefit from greater access to high-skilled talent graduating from Austins higher education institutions. Legislation like Congressman Smiths STEM Jobs Act will power greater job growth for Central Texas. Scott Corley, Compete America Executive Director: We thank Chairman Lamar Smith and the cosponsors of the STEM Jobs Act of 2012 for their commitment to ensuring America has the skilled workforce it needs to remain the world leader in innovation. We believe this bill is one of many important steps needed to reform our high skilled immigration system, and we look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion to pass critically needed reform legislation that can be signed into law by the president. Keith Grzelak, IEEE-USA Vice President for Government Relations: Enabling these graduates to become fully participating citizens will have a significant impact on our economy and create jobs. America is ready to put their skills, education and ideas to work here rather than for an overseas competitor so that Americans can benefit in the form of future jobs and economic activity here at home. Andy Halataei, Information Technology Industry Council Director of Government Relations: The STEM Jobs Act is a vital piece of legislation that moves the ball forward in reforming our nations high-skilled immigration system by keeping our highly educated STEM students here in the U.S. to create jobs and grow the economy here at home. We commend House Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith for introducing the STEM Jobs Act, which will help to halt the practice of educating and returning abroad our best STEM students to compete against us. U.S. Chamber of Commerce: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the worlds largest business federation representing the interests of more than three million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and region, strongly supports H.R. 6429, the STEM Jobs Act of 2012, which would spur innovation and create high paying manufacturing and research jobs in the U.S. by establishing a new green card program for advanced degree graduates in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ¦ H.R. 6429 would bolster American competitiveness by allocating up to55,000 green cards a year so these skilled innovators will create new jobs and products here in America rather than elsewhere.

09.20.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today held a hearing to examine the Obama administrations expansion of government regulations that burden businesses, stifle job creation and stall economic growth. According to the Heritage Foundation, in his first three years in office, President Obama adopted 106 major rules that impose $46 billion in additional annual regulatory costs on the private sector--a new record. To make matters worse, the Administrations latest regulatory agenda identifies over 200 major rules that are planned or have just been completed. Each of these rules will affect the economy by $100 million or more every year. A recent Gallup Poll found that among the 85% of U.S. small business owners who arent hiring, nearly half of these cited being worried about new government regulations as the reason they are not hiring. Chairman Smith: In his 2011 State of the Union Address, President Obama promised to fix ˜rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses. In his September 2011 address to a joint session of Congress, the President declared that ˜[we] should have no more regulation than the health, safety and security of the American people require. But his actions speak louder than his empty words. Rather than lighten regulatory burdens to promote recovery, President Obama has turned America into a regulation nation. Americas economic recovery depends on job creators, not federal regulators. We need to encourage small businesses to expand, not tie them up with red tape. Americas job creators dont need more government regulation. They need fewer burdens, lower costs and an environment in which they can predict whether they can hire and make a profit. To help address Americas economic troubles, the House Judiciary Committee passed a comprehensive package of regulatory reform bills this term of Congress. The bills, which were approved by the House of Representatives, reduce regulatory costs, while still protecting public health, safety and welfare. Despite his promises to lighten the regulatory load, President Obama has threatened to veto every one of these bills. The full text of Chairmans Smith statement at the hearing can be found here. A webcast of the hearing will be available on the House Judiciary Committee website later today.
09.18.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and nearly 50 Members of Congress today introduced bipartisan legislation to help the United States boost job creation, grow our economy, and remain globally competitive by increasing green cards for talented foreign graduates of American universities with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The STEM Jobs Act (H.R. 6429) eliminates the diversity visa lottery and reallocates up to 55,000 green cards a year to the top foreign graduates of U.S. universities with STEM doctorates. Any remaining green cards are then made available to foreign graduates with masters degrees in STEM fields. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the STEM Jobs Act this Thursday. Chairman Smith and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), an original cosponsor of the STEM Jobs Act, released the following statements on the bills introduction. Chairman Smith: Many of the worlds top students come to the U.S. to obtain advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects. We could boost economic growth and spur job creation by allowing American employers to more easily hire some of the most qualified foreign graduates of U.S. universities. These students have the ability to start a company that creates jobs or come up with an invention that could jump-start a whole new industry. In a global economy, we cannot afford to educate these foreign graduates in the U.S. and then send them back home to work for our competitors. For America to be to the worlds economic leader, we must have access to the worlds best talent. The STEM Jobs Act makes our immigration system smarter by eliminating the diversity visa program and reallocating up to 55,000 new green cards to the best foreign graduates with advanced degrees in STEM fields. This legislation will help us create jobs, increase our competitiveness, and spur our innovation. Rep. Cuellar: It is advantageous for the United States to retain the worlds finest in the STEM community to be able to be globally competitive in the workforce. The STEM Jobs Act gives an opportunity to foreign students who have acquired an advanced degree in the fields of science, math, and engineering to stay in the United States and exercise their professions, create jobs and spur economic growth domestically. In order to be competitive in todays global economy we have to provide immigrant students with this type of aid. The need for STEM professionals is expected to grow by 50% over the decade, according to the Labor Department, so we must be ready to fill those jobs with the best in the field. The STEM Jobs Act ensures that America can retain those we educate and enables us to compete on a global scale with those in STEM-related industries to create more opportunity and innovation for our nations future. Original cosponsors of H.R. 6429 include Reps. Bob Goodlatte, (R-Va.), Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), David Dreier (R-Calif.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Tim Griffin (R-Ark.), Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.), Dan Lungren (R-Calif.), Steve Chabot (R- Ohio), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Ted Poe (R-Texas), Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Sam Johnson (R-Texas), Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), Wally Herger (R-Calif.), Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.), Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.), Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), Kay Granger (R-Texas), Pete Sessions (R-Texas), Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Carter (R-Texas), Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), Michael Conaway (R-Texas), Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), Michael McCaul (R-Texas), Steve Pearce (R-N.M.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), Pete Olson (R-Texas), Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), Ann Marie Buerkle (R-N.Y.), Renee Elmers (R-N.C.), Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), David McKinley (R-W.Va.), Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), Dave Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), and Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.).

09.17.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today joined Humanities Texas in presenting a local teacher with the Outstanding Teaching of the Humanities Award. Deborah Magnon-Nolting, a social studies teacher at Randolph High School, is one of 13 recipients of the 2012 award. Ms. Magnon-Nolting has taught social studies in public schools for 35 years, the last 19 of which have been at Randolph High School. More than 300 teachers were nominated for the statewide award. Congressman Smith: This award recognizes not only Ms. Magnon-Noltings skill and talent as a teacher, but also her dedication to the educational excellence of her students. As any parent knows, it is not always easy to teach our children the lessons they need to know for their future. As a society, we entrust much of that work to our teachers. Ms. Magnon-Nolting deserves our appreciation and gratitude for her extraordinary efforts on behalf of our children. Ms. Magnon-Nolting will receive a $5,000 cash award from Humanities Texas and an additional $500 for Randolph High School to purchase humanities-based instructional materials.

09.14.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in favor of the No More Solyndras Act (H.R. 6213), a bill to better protect American taxpayers and prevent Obama administration officials from giving loan guarantees based off of political favoritism rather than financial credibility. The House of Representatives approved the bill by a vote of 245-161. Chairman Smith: We must put a stop to the Obama administrations use of taxpayer dollars to bail out campaign contributors at the expense of the American people. The No More Solyndras Act reins in the costly and misguided Department of Energy loan guarantee program and increases transparency to ensure that loans are not awarded as part of a partisan payback to political allies. The Presidents policies have failed to stimulate the economy and put Americans back to work. Rather than Solyndra-style economics, we need to promote projects like the Keystone Pipeline that we know will create jobs for American workers. The No More Solyndras Act phases out the Department of Energys (DOE) flawed loan guarantee program, adds protections for taxpayers to any new guarantee issued for an existing application, increases transparency by requiring DOE to report to Congress on existing applicants, and prohibits DOE from restructuring the terms of any guarantee without first consulting with the Treasury Department. Background on Solyndra Loan: Despite warnings about its financial stability from government officials, the Obama administration approved a loan guarantee for Solyndra in spring of 2009. According to documents obtained by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, approval for DOEs $535 million loan guarantee was rushed through in order to meet a press event deadline for Solyndras groundbreaking. Vice President Biden spoke at the event via satellite and hailed Solyndras ability to create permanent jobs. DOE officials ignored the advice of the Treasury Department, and in 2011 restructured the half-billion dollar loan to Solyndra so that private investors moved ahead of taxpayers for repayment on part of the loan in case of a default. In September 2011, Solyndra filed for bankruptcy. Just a few days later, the FBI raided the Solyndra offices.
09.13.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was recognized today by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) as a Guardian of Small Business. Smith earned the award for his strong record of supporting small business in the 112th Congress. Congressman Smith: Over the past 17 years, small businesses have generated 65% of the new jobs in this country. The President has tried to attribute the success of small businesses across the country to the federal government. But we know better. Americas economic recovery depends on job creators, not federal regulators. I am honored to receive this award, but I know that our work to protect small businesses from burdensome regulations and unnecessary tax hikes is not over. We need to lift the burden on small businesses and free them up to spend more, invest more, and produce more to create more jobs for American workers. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Smith sponsored and supported numerous bills to rein in regulations that burden small businesses and stifle job creation and economic growth. In the 112th Congress, the House of Representatives passed six House Judiciary Committee bills to reduce the impact of burdensome regulations on small businesses, and restore transparency and accountability to the regulatory process.
09.12.2012	The House Judiciary Committee today held a hearing to examine the Obama administrations abuse of power and its effect on our Constitution and economy. At the hearing, Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) outlined numerous ways that the Obama administration has placed a partisan agenda above the rule of law. For example, the President ignored immigration laws and enacted mass amnesty for potentially millions of illegal immigrants without Congressional approval. He bypassed the balance of powers by making recess appointments when the Senate was not in recess. The President continues to bombard the economy with arbitrary regulations that burden businesses and stifle job creation. And the Administration has shown contempt for Congresss oversight authority by stonewalling investigations into Operation Fast & Furious. Chairman Smith: Just because you dont like a law, doesnt mean you can ignore it. Many people have gone to jail for doing just that. It is easy to think of disputes about the Presidents power as abstract questions of constitutional theory, unimportant to anyone but law professors and DC insiders. But when the Administration repeatedly ignores constitutional and legal limits on the Presidents power, it undermines the rule of law with very real consequences. In 2008, the United States ranked number 1 in the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Report. In just four years, we have fallen to the 7th most competitive country in the world. According to the report, a large part of Americas lost competitiveness comes from the decline in faith in public institutions and the government. The Obama administrations continued abuse of authority contributes to this decline in faith in our institution and creates uncertainty that undermines Americas job creators and businesses. The full text of Chairmans Smith statement at the hearing can be found here. A webcast of the full hearing will be available on the House Judiciary Committee website later today.
09.10.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today congratulated the University of Texas on its receipt of an $18.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create and lead a nanosystems engineering research center. The new research center, called the Nanomanufacturing Systems for Mobile Computing and Mobile Energy Technologies (NASCENT), will use the funds to develop new nanotechnologies that will lead to product innovations and job creation for Austin-area engineers. Congressman Smith: The University of Texas remains a national leader for engineering and technology research and development. Todays grant recognizes the talent and skill of UT engineers and students, and places the future of our nations products and innovations in their hands. This is a tremendous achievement by UT faculty and researchers, and it benefits all Austin-area residents, consumers and job seekers. This grant and the work of the new UT research center will bring big advancements to the world of small technology. And it means better educational opportunities for UT undergraduate and Austin-area students who are interested in pursuing careers in science, technology, and engineering. According to the University of Texas, several industry partners will participate in NASCENT, including Texas Instruments, 3M, Lockheed Martin, Applied Materials and Corning, Inc., among others. The center plans to administer a pre-college program, identifying middle and high school students to participate in fellowships with the center and its partners. Congressman Smith serves on the House Committee on Science and Technology and is the Vice-Chair of the Space & Aeronautics Subcommittee. He is Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
08.30.2012	Washington, D.C. ” Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today released the following statement regarding a $4 million Department of Transportation Airport Improvement Program grant awarded to the San Antonio International Airport for noise mitigation efforts for area residents. Congressman Smith: I am pleased that my constituents living near the San Antonio International Airport who have lived with airport noise for several years will get relief from a recent $4 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration. These funds, along with other investments over the past six years, will go directly towards solutions that improve both the airport and the surrounding community. I look forward to seeing progress for local residents as well as for the many travelers who visit San Antonio. Background: Since 2006, efforts have been underway to mitigate the noise created by the San Antonio International Airport for the surrounding community. This September will mark the 1,000th sound-proofed home near the airport using federal assistance funds.
08.01.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, today voted to extend current income tax rates for one year for all Americans. Tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003 is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. The Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012 (H.R. 8) extends for one year the Bush-era tax cuts to prevent significant tax increases on middle class Americans at the end of this year. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 256-171. According to the Heritage Foundation, if the current tax rates are allowed to expire, citizens of the 21st District of Texas will see an average increase per tax return of $5,152 starting in 2013. Chairman Smith: America faces a national debt crisis because the federal government has spent too much, not because Americans are taxed too little. Tax rates have remained stable for the last ten years following the enactment of meaningful tax relief for the middle class under the Bush administration. Meanwhile, over the past five years, government spending has increased by nearly 40%. America now borrows 42 cents for every dollar it spends. This is the road to insolvency. But the solution is not more taxes on the American people, its less government spending. The Presidents policies have failed to spur our economy, failed to create more jobs, and failed to stop the federal governments spending spree. The Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act extends much-needed tax relief for all Americans for one year. This short-term fix ensures that American families are not faced with a massive tax hike at the end of the year. But more work still needs to be done to reduce the deficit, cut government spending, and promote sound fiscal policies for future generations. Background: H.R. 8 extends through December 31, 2013, the current individual income tax brackets of 10 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent, which are set to expire at the end of calendar year 2012. The below chart from the Wall Street Journal citing a Congressional Budget Office study shows the tax rate for American taxpayers. The top 20% of income earners (over $74,000) pay nearly 70% of all federal taxes. Despite the disproportionate tax burden they bear, under President Obamas tax plan, these wage earners will see an increase in their tax rate starting January 2013.
07.26.2012	The House today passed the Red Tape Reduction and Small Business Job Creation Act (H.R. 4078) by a vote of 245-172. The bill provides immediate relief to small businesses by freezing the most costly unnecessary regulations by the Obama administration. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), an original co-sponsor of the bill, praised the House vote. Chairman Smith: President Obama has turned America into a regulation nation. A Heritage Foundation study found that in his first three years in office President Obama adopted 106 major rules that impose $46 billion in additional annual regulatory costs on the private sector. We need to encourage businesses to expand, not tie them up with red tape. This bill gives small businesses a much-needed break from new regulations that cost the economy $50 million or more, until the unemployment rate stabilizes at six percent. Economic growth depends on job creators, not federal regulators. The Red Tape Reduction and Small Business Job Creation Act gives job creators confidence about future regulatory conditions, which will encourage them to make the investments that will jump-start our economy. This bill frees up businesses to spend more, invest more, and produce more in order to create more jobs for American workers. The Red Tape Reduction and Small Business Job Creation Act puts a moratorium on new regulations that cost the economy $50 million or more, until the unemployment rate stabilizes at six percent. The bill is narrowly tailored only to stop these unnecessary economically significant regulations. It contains reasonable exceptions, such as health and safety, criminal or civil rights laws, trade agreements and national security. The bill also streamlines the environmental review and construction permitting process to establish reasonable deadlines for agencies to complete the reviews and decide permit applications. Background on Regulation Reduction Bills: Last year, the House of Representatives passed three House Judiciary Committee bills to help reduce the impact of burdensome regulations on small businesses and the economy. The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 10) requires Congress to approve regulations that have an economic impact of $100 million or more before they can be imposed on the American people. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) requires federal agencies to identify and reduce the costs new regulations would impose on small businesses. The Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 3010) places permanent restrictions on regulatory agencies and restores accountability by requiring openness and transparency in the regulatory process. Chairman Smith sponsored both the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act and the Regulatory Accountability Act. He is a primary cosponsor of the REINS Act.
07.05.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today questioned Attorney General Eric Holder about the Justice Departments decision to hire an explicitly Democratic data firm to conduct analysis on the Texas voter identification law. According to court documents, the Justice Departments decision to block the implementation of the Texas law was based, in part, on the analysis provided by Catalist, a firm described by The Atlantic as a big Democratic data warehouse. In his letter to Attorney General Holder, Chairman Smith expressed serious concern about the credibility of the Departments case and the appropriateness of Catalists involvement. Excerpts from Chairmans letter are below. Chairman Smith: The Department of Justice has a responsibility to enforce and uphold the laws of the land without the influence of partisan politics ¦ This is why I was disappointed to learn that the Department hired an explicitly partisan Democratic data company, Catalist, to provide the data by which it is justifying its decision to block implementation of Texass voter identification law. Though Catalist is technically a private, for-profit company, it is really an agent of the Democratic Party. And Catalists involvement in the Departments election law litigation against Texas creates a clear conflict of interest. There is at least the appearance that, rather than election laws that protect Texans right to vote in a secure and fair election, Catalist might prefer that Texass election laws favor Democratic Party candidates. Equally troubling, nothing in the record indicates that the Department conducted an open bidding process when it obtained Catalists data services. I am concerned that the Justice Department may have prohibited other, non-partisan organizations from even bidding for the contract to review Texas voter ID law. If the Justice Department intentionally chose an organization with a left-leaning bias to review Texas voter ID law, this would be a disturbing misuse of taxpayer dollars and undermines the credibility of the Departments challenge to the law¦ It is unacceptable for the Department to go into court in a case involving the integrity of Texas elections on the basis of data provided by a Democratic Party campaign operation. Imagine the outrage if a Republican administration intervened to block a New York City election law on the basis of data provided by a firm run by Karl Rove. The Departments engagement of Catalist in blocking Texass voter identification law is no different. I ask you to explain why the public should have faith in the neutrality and impartiality of the data provided by Catalist that the Department is citing to support its legal position ¦ If you cannot vouch for Catalists non-partisan independence and reliability, then I request that you drop the Departments objections to Texass voter identification law. The Department should never ask a federal court to adopt a voting rights theory that is based on partisan political strategy rather than neutral analysis of the facts and law. Chairman Smith requested the Department respond to his letter by Monday, July 9. A copy of Chairman Smiths letter to Attorney General Holder can be found here.
06.29.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced legislation to protect children from sexual exploitation. The Child Protection Act of 2012 (H.R. 6063) increases penalties for the possession of child pornography, raises funding and resources for the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Forces and provides additional protections to child victims and witnesses. The bill also improves the ability of the U.S. Marshals Service to apprehend fugitive sex offenders by giving them express administrative subpoena authority, however only for fugitive investigations of unregistered sex offenders. Chairman Smith: Trafficking of child pornography images was almost completely eradicated in America by the mid-1980s. Purchasing or trading these images was risky and almost impossible to do anonymously. But the advent of the Internet reversed this accomplishment. Today Internet child pornography may be the fastest growing crime in America, increasing an average of 150% per year. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Childrens Child Victim Identification Program has reviewed more than 51 million child pornography images and videos in the hopes of identifying the victims in them. These images of children being sexually assaulted are crime scene photos “ and each face represents a child in desperate need of help. Every day these online criminals prey on our children with virtual anonymity. The Child Protection Act of 2012 provides law enforcement officials with important tools to combat the growing threat of child exploitation. We must ensure that investigators have every available resource to track down predators and protect the weakest among us. This bill ensures that paperwork does not stand in the way of protecting our kids. It gives the U.S. Marshals tasked with tracking down these predators the legal tools they need, and it helps prevent more victims by raising the penalties for those who hurt our children. Congressman Smith introduced the bill today with Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) and 29 additional cosponsors.
06.28.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to the Supreme Courts ruling in Obamacare: Chairman Smith: While millions of Americans are disappointed by todays decision, Congress will not be deterred in our commitment to repeal Obamacare. The individual mandate may have been found to be constitutional as a tax, but that doesnt make it good policy for the American people. The Presidents promises about Obamacare have proved hollow. Obamacare costs our economy trillions of dollars, imposes new and burdensome taxes on the American people, and drives up costs for employers. Under this law, millions of Americans will be forced to abandon their current health care plans and change doctors. Decisions about treatment for certain illnesses will be made by a panel in Washington, D.C. rather than by patients and their physicians. Todays decision not only upholds bad policy, it sets a dangerous precedent about the power of the federal government. Never before in our nations history has the federal government required people to purchase a good or service simply because they live in the U.S. “ until now. Our Founders created a system of government where the power belongs to the people. Part of living in a free society means having the freedom to choose not to do something. Unfortunately, this ruling gives the federal government too much power over the daily lives of Americans. While President Obama may have won in the Supreme Court today, he has lost in the court of public opinion. A recent Reuters poll found that 56% of respondents oppose Obamacare and 61% oppose the individual mandate. House Republicans will continue to do our part to repeal Obamacare and enact real reforms that reduce health care costs without restricting the rights of Americans. But if the American people want to overturn todays ruling, they must show up at the polls in November and elect a new President and members of Congress who oppose Obamacare.
06.28.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today voted in support of a resolution to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. The House approved the contempt resolution by a vote of 255-67. Chairman Smith: Todays vote to hold Attorney General Holder in contempt of Congress is unprecedented, but unfortunately so are the obstructionist actions of this Justice Department. The Attorney General continues to put himself above the law by refusing to cooperate with legitimate congressional inquiries. For more than a year and a half, this Administration has blocked inquiries and delayed responses about what really happened in Operation Fast & Furious. The Presidents recent assertion of Executive Privilege covers communication between top Executive staff. The Administration cannot claim that top officials were not aware of the program and then assert this privilege. They cant have it both ways. Either no senior staff was aware of Fast & Furious, in which case Executive Privilege does not apply; or senior staff was aware, which means the Administration has not been truthful with Congress. Congress has a constitutional duty to conduct legitimate oversight of the Administrations actions, especially when those actions contribute to the death of a U.S. citizen. The Attorney Generals attempts to block our investigation are irresponsible and undermine the balance of powers on which our nation was founded. It is disappointing that the Attorney General has refused to fulfill his duty to Congress. And since he refuses to comply, we have no choice but to hold him in contempt of Congress and move to challenge his actions in federal court. Background: Today. the House of Representatives voted to hold the Attorney General in criminal contempt of Congress for his failure to respond to a subpoena issued by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The contempt of Congress resolution is now referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for prosecution. Later today the House will vote to authorize the Oversight & Government Reform Committee to go to court to enforce its subpoena.
06.21.2012	The House of Representatives today passed legislation to reduce energy costs and spur economic growth and job creation. Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) supported the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act (H.R. 4480), which was approved by a vote of 248-163. The Act is a package of seven domestic energy production bills that were introduced this Congress. Congressman Smith: When President Obama took office, gas was $1.89 per gallon. Today, gas is almost twice as expensive with a national average of $3.47 per gallon. The Presidents policies have failed to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, failed to lessen the burden of energy costs on families, and failed to create jobs for American workers. House Republicans are committed to providing comprehensive solutions that increase domestic energy production and rein in unnecessary regulations that stall innovation. We have passed nine bills to expand drilling for oil and natural gas, and mining for coal. Unfortunately, President Obama and Senate Democrats continue to block much-needed domestic energy production that could help create jobs for hundreds of thousands of American workers The American people want policies that embrace domestic resources and get them back to work. Todays vote continues the Republican commitment to providing real solutions to ever-expanding energy costs and our sluggish economy. The Domestic Energy and Jobs Act helps job creators in the energy industry invest more in American-made energy and American jobs. According to a recent survey by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, 72 percent of small businesses report they are affected by high energy prices. Of these businesses, 41 percent report that they have altered hiring plans and another 22 percent report reducing employee hours because of high energy costs. More information about H.R. 4480 can be found here.
06.21.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today congratulated staff from O. Henry Middle School in Austin, Texas for being named a School to Watch in 2012 by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle Grades Reform. O. Henry Middle School was one of 103 schools selected by the organization. It was one of six schools from Texas selected for the honor. Educators and members of the staff at O. Henry Middle School were in Washington, D.C. for the National Forums 8th annual Schools to Watch conference. Congressman Smith met with O. Henry Middle School staff and praised their achievement. Congressman Smith: The principal and staff at O. Henry Middle School deserve our appreciation and gratitude for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of our children. This is a well-deserved national recognition of their hard work and dedication to educational excellence of their students. I hope that O. Henry Middle School continues to serve as a shining example of how talented teachers and engaged administrators can shape the minds and futures of Americas children. The National Forum to Accelerate Middle Grades Reform is an alliance of more than 60 educators, researchers, and officers of national associations and foundations dedicated to improving schools for young adolescents across the country. In April, Congressman Smith joined more than 100 students at O. Henry Middle School in a live video discussion with astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Congressman Smith kicked off the discussion with the space station and spoke to students about the importance of space exploration and science education. A photo of Congressman Smith and representatives of O. Henry Middle School is attached. Left to right: Pete Price (Principal), Erika Thomsen Swan (English), Congressman Lamar Smith, Dana Phillips (English), and Jennifer Boltz (Band).
06.15.2012	The Department of Homeland Security today announced that it will stop deporting and begin giving work permits to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) criticized the Obama administrations announcement in the statement below. Chairman Smith: President Obamas decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants is a breach of faith with the American people. It also blatantly ignores the rule of law that is the foundation of our democracy. This huge policy shift has horrible consequences for unemployed Americans looking for jobs and violates President Obamas oath to uphold the laws of this land. President Obamas amnesty only benefits illegal immigrants, not Americans, and is a magnet for fraud. Many illegal immigrants will falsely claim they came here as children and the federal government has no way to check whether their claims are true. And once these illegal immigrants are granted deferred action, they can then apply for a work permit, which the Administration routinely grants 90% of the time. How can the Administration justify allowing illegal immigrants to work in the U.S. when millions of Americans are unemployed? President Obama and his administration once again have put partisan politics and illegal immigrants ahead of the rule of law and the American people. With this track record, its looking more likely that even President Obama may lose his job in this economy when Americans go to the polls this November.
06.07.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) grilled Attorney General Eric Holder at a hearing today in Washington, D.C. about whether White House officials were aware of ATFs Operation Fast & Furious, which contributed to the shooting death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. The Attorney General appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for an oversight hearing on the Justice Departments activities. Outstanding questions surrounding the controversial ATF operation that allowed guns to be purchased in the U.S. and trafficked to Mexico dominated the Committees discussion. Chairman Smith expressed concern with Attorney General Holders leadership of the Justice Department and the Obama administrations efforts to impose a partisan agenda on the American people. Chairman Smith: For the past three and half years, this Administration has engaged in a pattern of obstructionism, unaccountability, and partisanship. The Administrations actions arent just wrong--they are arrogant, undemocratic, and an insult to the rule of law. The American people should have confidence that the Department of Justice fairly enforces laws. That confidence is lacking today. In April, Chairman Smith issued a report on the Justice Departments disregard for the Constitution and rule of law. The report outlines high profile examples of how the Justice Department has ignored the Constitution in order to impose the Administrations partisan agenda on the American people. From blocking investigations of Operation Fast & Furious and Justice Elena Kagans involvement in Obamacare to refusing to enforce and defend certain laws, the Attorney General has allowed a partisan agenda to guide the Justice Departments decisions. A copy of Chairman Smiths hearing remarks can be found here. A full webcast from todays hearing will be available on the House Judiciary Committee website later today.
06.01.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today issued the following statement after the U.S. Department of Labor reported that only 69,000 jobs were created in May and the unemployment rate rose to 8.2 percent. Chairman Smith: Todays unemployment report is further proof that the Obama administrations policies of higher taxes and increased government spending are making the economy worse. Since President Obama took office, almost one million more Americans are out of work, we have run up the three largest deficits in U.S. history, and small businesses are strapped with an unprecedented number of costly new regulations that hinder growth and stall job creation. We must make real, meaningful change to the economy and put our country on the road to recovery by passing legislation that cuts government spending, reduces waste, reins in burdensome regulations and helps grow our economy. Background: Last year, the House of Representatives passed three Judiciary Committee bills to help reduce the impact of burdensome regulations on small businesses and the economy. The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 10) requires Congress to approve regulations that have an economic impact of $100 million or more before they can be imposed on the American people. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) requires federal agencies to identify and reduce the costs new regulations would impose on small businesses. The Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 3010) places permanent restrictions on regulatory agencies and restores accountability by requiring openness and transparency in the regulatory process. Chairman Smith sponsored both the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act and the Regulatory Accountability Act. He is a primary cosponsor of the REINS Act. ###
06.01.2012	Congressmen Lamar Smith (TX-21) and John Carter (TX-31) congratulated students from Westwood High School for placing second in the 10-12 grade division at the Toshiba/National Science Teachers Association ExploraVision Contest, a nationwide science competition focused on the future of technological innovation. The Westwood High students were awarded second place for their team project, which integrates nanotechnology, photothermal therapy, and biomecular recognition in pancreatic cancer therapy. More than 4,800 entries and 14,600 students from the U.S. and Canada competed in the 20th annual Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision Contest. Corinne Alford, Aneesha Kommineni, Eley Ng, and Shruti Subramanian were each awarded a $5,000 U.S. Savings Bond. Congressman Smith: I congratulate the Westwood team on their extraordinary achievement in the national ExploraVision Competition. Its not every day that you see high school students developing new technologies to treat cancer. Soon to be seniors in high school, these students to continue their pursuit of scientific exploration and discovery in college, and I hope they will inspire their classmates to do the same. We can all be encouraged that these are the bright minds of Americas future. Congressman Carter: This is precisely the type of science education achievement we need to be promoting as a nation. These young people are showing the way forward in both health improvements and technological competitiveness in a global economy. I congratulate our students, their parents and teachers, and the Association for their success with this program and for helping build a stronger science future for America. Congressman Smith is vice-chair of the House Science Committees Space & Aeronautics Subcommittee. He supports legislation to help encourage science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education for Americas youth.

05.15.2012	The House of Representatives today approved a bill to help create a nationwide alert system to identify and apprehend suspects when a law enforcement officer is injured or killed in the line of duty. The National Blue Alert Act of 2012 (H.R. 365) directs the Department of Justice to designate an existing law enforcement officer to serve as the Blue Alert national coordinator to encourage and assist states across the country in establishing Blue Alert plans. The House passed the bill with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 394-1. Similar to Amber Alerts for missing children, the Blue Alert system is a cooperative effort among local, state, and federal authorities, law enforcement agencies and the general public. A Blue Alert broadcasts information about an offender who is still at large, which may include a description of the offenders vehicle or license plate number, to help speed the suspects apprehension. So far, 14 states have Blue Alert networks in place, and Ohio will implement its network in June. Texas established a Blue Alert network in 2008. Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which oversees federal law enforcement agencies, managed debate on the House floor and encouraged his colleagues to support the bill. Chairman Smith: Each year, hundreds of law enforcement officers are killed or seriously injured in the line of duty. In 1789, President George Washington appointed Americas first law enforcement officers “ 13 United States Marshals. Since then, over 21,000 local, state, and federal law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty. Just last month, in my home state of Texas, an Austin Police officer was shot and killed while responding to a call about a drunk man shoplifting at the local Walmart. What seemed to be a routine call turned out to be a dangerous and deadly situation. We cannot bring Officer Padron back, but we can honor his sacrifice by helping to apprehend and bring to justice criminals who harm our men and women in Blue. The goal of a Blue Alert is to immediately notify the entire community to assist in the location and apprehension of violent criminals who injure or kill police officers. A nationwide Blue Alert network will be particularly effective when a suspect flees across state lines. This bill reaffirms our determination to ensure the future safety of our law enforcement men and women and the communities they protect. Despite the fact that national crime rates continue to drop, 163 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in 2011, a 14 percent increase over the previous year. Part of Police Week, May 15 is the National Peace Officers Memorial Day. Supporters of this legislation include the National Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association.
05.08.2012	The House Judiciary Committee today approved a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) for five years. The Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization of 2012 (H.R. 4970) ensures that federal resources authorized by VAWA go directly to organizations and programs that help prevent violent crime and protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The House bill provides the same levels of funding for VAWA grant programs as the Senate-passed bill. The Committee voted 17-15 to reauthorize VAWA. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a co-sponsor of the bill, today praised the Committee vote. Chairman Smith: Since its enactment in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has helped many women escape abuse and enabled them to seek help through its victim-services program. The House bill fully reauthorizes the VAWA grant programs at the same funding levels as the Senate bill. The bill provides more than $650 million in funding per year to help prevent domestic violence and protect victims of abuse. In Texas, I have seen first-hand the importance of this Act. Under VAWA, a domestic violence hotline was established in 1996 that has since answered nearly 2.5 million calls and saved many lives. It is essential that programs like these are in place to protect victims, not just from the physical bruises, but from the emotional and mental scars as well. In addition to providing funding, this reauthorization strengthens penalties for sexual assault and abuse, promotes educational awareness to prevent violence, and increases accountability for grant recipients. By reauthorizing VAWA, we can help victims of violence get the care they need and justice they deserve. For more information about the reauthorization of VAWA, please visit the House Judiciary Committee website.
04.30.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today released a report on the U.S. Justice Departments disregard of the Constitution and rule of law. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Smith is leading efforts to oversee Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department. Rather than enforce the law and uphold the Constitution, the Obama administration has placed partisanship above the rule of law. Chairman Smith: The Justice Department has a responsibility to enforce the laws of the land and protect the Constitution. Of all federal agencies, the Justice Department should not be motivated by a partisan agenda. Unfortunately, under this Administration, the Justice Department has become more partisan than ever. The Obama administration has ignored the constitutional balance of power between co-equal branches of government and blocked investigations of its actions. When the Administration doesnt like a law, they refuse to enforce it. And if the Senates constitutional authority to approve political appointees gets in their way, the Administration ignores the Constitution. All government officials are bound by the limits of the Constitution and the rule of law, including the President and the Attorney General. Unfortunately, this Administration continues to put a partisan agenda ahead of the Constitution and the rule of law. The report outlines high profile examples of how the Justice Department has ignored the Constitution in order to impose the Administrations partisan agenda on the American people. From blocking investigations of Operation Fast & Furious and Justice Elena Kagans involvement in Obamacare to refusing to enforce and defend certain laws, the Attorney General has allowed a partisan agenda to guide the Justice Departments decisions. Chairman Smith announced that he has called Attorney General Eric Holder to testify before the Judiciary Committee on June 7, 2012, to answer for the Administrations actions. A summary and full copy of the report can be found on the House Judiciary Committee website.
04.19.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith today voted to support the Small Business Tax Cut Act (H.R. 9) to give every small business with fewer than 500 employees a 20 percent tax deduction. The House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 235-173. This legislation frees up funds for 22 million small businesses to retain workers, hire new employees and grow our economy. Chairman Smith, who cosponsored the bill, issued the following statement today after the House vote. Chairman Smith: Over the past 17 years, small businesses have generated 65% of the new jobs in this country. While small businesses face sun-setting income tax cuts and expiring temporary payroll tax cuts, the Obama administration continues to raise taxes and impose new regulations on millions of small businesses. We need to encourage small businesses to expand, not tie them up with more taxes and red tape. The Small Business Tax Cut Act lowers tax rates on small businesses and frees them up to spend more, invest more, and produce more in order to create more jobs. Their recovery is the key to getting more Americans back to work. More information about the Small Business Tax Cut Act can be found at: https://www.majorityleader.gov/SmallBiz/.
04.10.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today hosted a job fair for Austin-area residents seeking employment. Fifty-eight employers and more than 600 job seekers participated in the event. The job fair was hosted in cooperation with Workforce Solutions Capital Area. Congressman Smith: In these difficult economic times, there are still too many unemployed residents looking for work in our states Capital. Thats why today I hosted a job fair for Austin-area residents to connect job seekers with local job creators looking to hire. We had more than 55 employers participate and over 600 job seekers attend the event. Austin is a great place to live and work. I appreciate all the employers and groups that participated in todays event and hope that it helps Austin-area job seekers find long-term and lasting employment. Alan Miller, Executive Director for Workforce Solutions Capital Area: Workforce Solutions Capital Area is pleased to partner with Congressman Smith on this job fair. Any opportunity to help connect employers and job seekers is beneficial and we appreciate the Congressmans efforts in helping put Austin back to work. Employers at todays event included AT&T, the Austin Police Department, Dell, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, eBay, Seton Health Care, and UT Austin.

04.03.2012	Today, Congressman Smith (TX-21) joined more than 100 students at O. Henry Middle School in a live video discussion with astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Congressman Smith kicked off the discussion with the space station and spoke to students about the importance of space exploration and science education. American astronauts Dan Burbank and Don Pettit, along with European astronaut AndrÃ© Kuipers, answered questions from students via a live television downlink to teach students about living and working in space. Congressman Smith: For over ten years, NASA astronauts have been living and working onboard the International Space Station, an amazing engineering achievement. The Space Station is roughly the size of a football field and has more livable space than a five-bedroom house. It includes science laboratories for six astronauts living and working onboard. Gene Cernan, the last American astronaut to set foot on the Moon, recently testified before Congress about the importance of science education saying, ˜Tell young people in school today to keep shooting for the Moon”to study math, science, and engineering”because even if they miss the Moon theyll still be amongst the stars. My hope for the students we met today is that many will pursue careers in science and use their knowledge to explore strange new worlds and better understand our universe. Congressman Smith is vice-chair of the House Science Committees Space & Aeronautics Subcommittee. He supports legislation to help encourage science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education for Americas youth. Events like today are part of NASAs Teaching from Space Program, which supports learning opportunities and builds partnerships with the education community using the unique environment of space. This in-flight education downlink is one in a series with educational organizations in the United States to encourage STEM teaching and learning.
03.29.2012	The United States Chamber of Commerce today honored Congressman Lamar Smith with its annual Spirit of Enterprise award for his support of pro-jobs, pro-growth policies during the first session of the 112th Congress. Congressman Smith: Whether its cutting red tape and reducing burdensome regulations on businesses, or simplifying our tax code, I believe Congress should support policies that encourage the private sector to invest and grow. I will continue to sponsor and support legislation to expand our economy and create jobs for American workers. Thomas J. Donohue, the President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, praised Congressman Smith for his efforts on behalf of American workers and businesses. President Donohue: Over the past year, Congressman Smith has worked to protect and advance the interests of Americas job creators. By supporting pro-growth policies, Congressman Smith is helping unleash the power of free enterprise to put our economy back on track and put Americans back to work. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Smith has sponsored bills to help spur the economy, grow businesses and create jobs for American workers. Chairman Smith sponsored the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, a bill that reduces frivolous litigation and ensures faster approval of better patents. The America Invents Act is the most-significant bipartisan, jobs creation law to be enacted this Congress. Last year, the House of Representatives approved three Judiciary Committee bills to help reduce the burden of unnecessary regulations on small businesses and the economy. Chairman Smith sponsored the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) and the Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 3010), which require federal agencies to identify and reduce the costs of regulations on small businesses. Congressman Smith is a primary cosponsor of the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 10), which requires Congress to consider regulations that have an economic impact of $100 million or more before they can be imposed on the American people. Congressman Smith maintained a 100% rating with the Chamber of Commerce this year and holds a lifetime 93% rating during his tenure in Congress.
03.29.2012	The House of Representatives today passed the FY 2013 House Republican budget resolution to cut federal spending and address the national debt crisis. The Path to Prosperity, introduced by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), passed by a vote of 228-191. The plan includes real spending discipline, patient-centered health care reforms, and pro-growth tax reform. Chairman Smith issued the following statement today after the House budget vote. Chairman Smith: Since President Obama took office, almost one million more Americans are out of work and we have run up the three largest deficits in U.S. history. But the Presidents solution to the nations debt crisis is more of the same. The Presidents budget proposal increases spending by $1.5 trillion. And to pay for this increase in spending, the Obama administration imposes a $2 trillion tax increase on American taxpayers. The Presidents policies of higher taxes and increased government spending are making the economy worse. Compared to the President's proposal, the Republican plan cuts spending by $5 trillion and reduces deficits by over $3 trillion. The Republican Path to Prosperity puts our country on the road to recovery by stopping President Obamas tax increases and repealing his government takeover of health care, which the Congressional Budget Office now estimates will cost twice as much as originally thought. The Republican budget is a good step in the right direction, but more must be done to reduce the deficit and protect our nations future. I will continue to support legislation that cuts government spending, reduces waste, reins in burdensome regulations and helps grow our economy. More information about the Path to Prosperity Budget can be found at: https://budget.house.gov/prosperity/.
03.22.2012	The House of Representatives today approved legislation to repeal part of Obamacare and implement medical liability reforms to reduce frivolous lawsuits that drive up the cost of health care. The House voted 223-181 to pass H.R. 5, the Protecting Access to Healthcare (PATH) Act. The PATH Act repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a committee of 15 federal employees created by Obamacare who can make major cuts to Medicare that are likely to limit seniors access to treatment and services. The PATH Act also addresses the costly practice of defensive medicine by incorporating lawsuit abuse reforms that have proved effective in states like California and Texas at reducing costs and increasing access to care. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) managed the floor debate on the PATH Acts provision to help reduce frivolous malpractice suits. Chairman Smith applauded the House vote to repeal the IPAB and enact meaningful medical liability reforms. Chairman Smith: Todays vote to repeal the IPAB ensures that decisions over medical care are made by patients and their doctors rather than a panel of unelected and unaccountable government officials in Washington, D.C. Despite roadblocks in the Senate, Republicans remain committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing the Presidents health care law with common-sense solutions that curb costs, expand access to care, and eliminate unfair and unconstitutional mandates and penalties. The PATH Act includes meaningful malpractice reforms to address frivolous lawsuits that amount to legalized extortion of doctors and hospitals. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, 40% of medical malpractice suits filed in the U.S. are ˜without merit. These suits drive up the costs of health care and drive many medical professionals out of business. Unlike Obamacare, the medical liability reforms in the PATH Act save American taxpayers money. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that medical liability reforms in the PATH Act will reduce the federal budget deficit by more than $45 billion over the next ten years. The PATH Act puts our health care system on the road to recovery and takes us one step closer to repealing President Obamas unprecedented and unconstitutional government takeover of health care. Chairman Smith sponsored the medical liability reforms incorporated in the PATH Act, including a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages and limits on the contingency fees lawyers can charge. There is no cap on the amount of economic costs that can be reimbursed. A full copy of Chairman Smiths floor remarks can be found here: https://judiciary.house.gov/news/HR%205%20Floor%20Statement.html
03.22.2012	Tomorrow marks the two-year anniversary of the enactment of the Presidents health care law, which includes an individual mandate requiring all Americans to purchase health insurance from a private company regardless of whether they want to or not. This week, House Republicans voted to repeal another provision of Obamacare and replace the law with proven lawsuit abuse reforms that we know reduce health care costs. The PATH Act repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a panel of 15 federal employees created by Obamacare who can make major cuts to Medicare that are likely to restrict seniors access to treatment and services. Republicans have voted 26 times to fully repeal, defund or dismantle portions of the health care law. Chairman Smith: Two years later and the Presidents health care law is twice as bad as we first thought. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) announced that Obamacare will cost almost double its original $900 billion price tag. The Presidents policies have failed, and his health care law is making the economy worse. Thats why this week House Republicans continued our efforts to repeal the Presidents government takeover of health care and replace it with common-sense reforms that lower costs and increase access. We passed the PATH Act to repeal the IPAB and ensure that decisions over medical care are made by patients and their doctors rather than a panel of unelected and unaccountable government officials. The legislation also includes meaningful malpractice reforms to address frivolous lawsuits that amount to legalized extortion of doctors and hospitals. Unlike Obamacare, medical liability reforms in the PATH Act save American taxpayers money. The CBO estimates that reforms included in this legislation will reduce the federal budget deficit by more than $45 billion over the next ten years. Despite roadblocks in the Democrat-controlled Senate, Republicans remain committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing the Presidents takeover of health care with common-sense solutions that curb costs, expand access to care, and eliminate unfair and unconstitutional mandates and penalties. Twenty-seven states are challenging the constitutionality of Obamacare and oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court begin next week.
03.20.2012	The House Judiciary Committee today approved a bill to provide immediate relief to small businesses and freeze the implementation of significant regulations by the Obama administration. The Regulatory Freeze for Jobs Act of 2012 (H.R. 4078), which was introduced by Congressman Tim Griffin (R-Ark), puts a moratorium on new significant regulations until the national unemployment rate stabilizes at or below six percent. The bill was approved by a vote of 15-13. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), an original co-sponsor of the bill, today praised the Committee vote. Chairman Smith: The Obama administration has quickly turned the United States into a regulation nation. This Administration has adopted an unprecedented amount of costly new regulations, which hinder small business growth and stall job creation. According to a study by the Small Business Administration, regulations cost the American economy $1.75 trillion annually. We need to encourage small businesses to expand, not tie them up with red tape. Unfortunately, rather than add much-needed jobs to the economy, the Obama administration has only added job-killing regulations that burden businesses and stifle economic growth. In 2011, the Obama administrations agenda had over 200 ˜economically significant new rules, each of which typically affect the American economy $100 million or more each year. The Freeze Act gives small businesses a much-needed break from new significant federal regulations until the unemployment rate stabilizes at six percent. The Act encourages job creators to make the kinds of investments that will jump-start our economy and gives them confidence about future regulatory actions. The Freeze Act helps lift the burden on small businesses and frees them up to spend more, invest more, and produce more in order to create more jobs for American workers. H.R. 4078 is narrowly tailored only to stop unnecessary regulations. The bill contains reasonable exceptions for significant regulations that are necessary to protect health and safety, for national security, to enforce criminal laws or to implement trade agreements. Information on todays markup of the Freeze Act can be found here: https://www.judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202012/mark_03202012.html Background on Regulation Reduction Bills: Last year, the House of Representatives passed three House Judiciary Committee bills to help reduce the impact of burdensome regulations on small businesses and the economy. The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 10) requires Congress to approve regulations that have an economic impact of $100 million or more before they can be imposed on the American people. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) requires federal agencies to identify and reduce the costs new regulations would impose on small businesses. The Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 3010) places permanent restrictions on regulatory agencies and restores accountability by requiring openness and transparency in the regulatory process. Chairman Smith sponsored both the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act and the Regulatory Accountability Act. He is a primary cosponsor of the REINS Act.
03.14.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith hosted a small business forum today at Northeast Lakeview College in Universal City. Over 80 local small business owners attended this forum to learn about sources of available funding, government contracts and guidance on website development and use of social media. Congressman Smith hosted the forum in cooperation with the South-West Texas Border SBDC Network and the UTSA Institute for Economic Development. Congressman Smith: Small business owners play a critical role in our economy and are vital to building strong communities. I was pleased to host this forum to help local small business owners gain valuable information that will benefit their businesses. San Antonios small business community is strong, as a recent report showed that small businesses in the Alamo City increased hiring more than any other U.S. city in 2011. I hope this forum was useful to help small businesses in San Antonio continue to grow and thrive. Last week the House of Representatives delivered some good news for small business owners across the nation. We passed the JOBS Act, a package of measures designed to help small businesses access capital and reduce the red tape that stifles economic growth. We need to lift the burden on small businesses and free them up to spend more, invest more and produce more in order to create more jobs for American workers. Morrison Woods, Director of the UTSA Small Business Development Center: We are pleased to be collaborating with the Congressman's office to bring this information to small business owners. We're fortunate to live in San Antonio and Texas because of our strong economy. The SBDC is here to support entrepreneurs succeed and make the economy even stronger. We are growing the Texas economy one business at a time.
03.12.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized the Obama administrations decision to challenge Texas voter ID law. Chairman Smith: Todays decision by the Justice Department to challenge Texas voter ID law is another example of the Obama administrations abuse of executive authority. The people of Texas overwhelmingly supported the States law to require individuals to show official identification documentation, like a drivers license or passport, before being allowed to vote. The foundation of our democracy rests on secure and fair elections. Unfortunately, voter fraud undermines the electoral process and can sway the ultimate outcome of elections. Illegal votes negate the votes of legal voters. Voter ID laws help ensure the integrity of our elections and protect the rights of lawful voters. If citizens are required to show ID in order to open a bank account, cash a check, drive a car or board a plane, how much more important is it to show ID in order to exercise one of our most valuable democratic rights? "The Texas voter ID law is based off of the Indiana law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court. This is an abuse of executive authority and an affront to the citizens of Texas. Its time for the Obama administration to learn not to mess with Texas.

02.06.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement today: The Obama administration is threatening the foundation of religious freedoms that America was built on with their decision to require all employers, including faith-based organizations, to provide contraceptive coverage. All citizens should be free to practice their religious beliefs. This drastic government overreach could have far-reaching consequences. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of H.R. 1179, the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act. This legislation amends the health care law to permit a health plan to decline coverage of specific items and services that are contrary to the religious belief of the sponsor or issuer. I will continue fighting to protect the constitutional rights of religious organizations in this country.
02.01.2012	Congressman Smith released the following statement today after the House voted to repeal the Community Living Assistance Services and Support (CLASS) program, an entitlement program for long-term care payments that was inserted in the health care law. The program was written to make it appear it would cost less than it really would. It is clear that this $80 billion budget gimmick was never a viable solution. Despite warnings from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that ˜this program would collapse in short order, Democrats went ahead with inserting it into their health care law so they could tout savings that didnt exist. Even the Obama administration has since admitted the program cannot work. Now that the House has acted to remove this unsustainable new entitlement program, I hope the Senate will move to repeal this unworkable policy. The unconstitutional health care law should be repealed entirely and replaced with legislation that expands access to care while curbing costs, and eliminating unfair mandates and penalties.
01.31.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today pressed the Justice Department to make senior officials available for interviews with the Committee regarding the Departments knowledge of ATFs Operation Fast and Furious following the shooting death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010. Specifically, Chairman Smith requested to interview Monty Wilkinson, former Deputy Chief of Staff to the Attorney General, and Lanny Breuer, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. Documents released by the Department on Friday indicate that the Attorney Generals former Deputy Chief of Staff may have been aware of the connection between Agent Terrys death and Operation Fast and Furious within days of the shooting. The emails also show inconsistencies between statements by Assistant Attorney General Breuer regarding his reaction to the initial discovery that ATF had engaged in gunwalking. Chairman Smith: The House Judiciary Committee and the American people have a right to know the whole truth, not just bits and pieces released here and there over several months. As Attorney General, you have an obligation to ensure that the statements given to Congress are both accurate and complete. Unfortunately, the documents released by the Department continue to raise serious questions about the validity of statements made by senior Department officials. Last Friday, the Justice Department released 486 new documents to the House Judiciary and House Oversight Committees as part of compliance with a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee. The emails show an exchange between Mr. Wilkinson and former U.S. Attorney for Arizona Dennis Burke regarding the death of Agent Terry. Mr. Wilkinson claimed to have notified the Attorney General about the death of Agent Terry and then pressed U.S. Attorney Burke for additional details regarding the shooting. U.S. Attorney Burke later notified Mr. Wilkinson that guns found at the scene of the shooting connected back to the investigation we were going to talk about. The investigation in question turned out to be Operation Fast and Furious. Mr. Wilkinson replied, Ill call tomorrow. It is not known if that call ever took place. Chairman Smith requested that the Department contact the House Judiciary Committee by February 10 to arrange for the interviews of Mr. Wilkinson and Assistant Attorney General Breuer. A copy of the full letter can be found here.
01.24.2012	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement today in response to President Obamas State of the Union address. Since President Obama took office, almost 2 million more Americans are out of work, and we have run up the three largest deficits in U.S. history. His policies of higher taxes and increased government spending are making our economy worse. We know what our nations job creators need from Washington - more certainty and less costly regulations. Tax increases discourage hiring and prolong economic uncertainty. Getting our economy back on track requires leadership from President Obama and Democrats in the Senate. Instead, 27 jobs bills that have been passed by the House are awaiting Senate action. Unfortunately the President missed an opportunity tonight to focus on the pro-growth policies that will move our economy forward.
01.23.2012	Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today announced that the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on February 15 to examine questions regarding the constitutionality of recent recess appointments by the Obama administration. Chairman Smith released the following statement regarding the Presidents recess appointments of Richard Cordray as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and three individuals to the National Labor Relations Board. Chairman Smith: President Obamas recent appointments are unprecedented and possibly unconstitutional. The President may make appointments while the Senate is in recess, however these appointments were made while the Senate was not”something no other President has attempted. The Constitution gives the Senate the authority to determine the rules of its proceedings. The President cannot unilaterally decide to rush through ˜recess appointments while the Senate is not in recess. Doing so threatens the oversight powers of the Senate and the separation of powers that is fundamental to our Constitution. And it sets a dangerous precedent for future administrations that want to avoid transparency and the constitutional role of the Senate to vote on certain nominations. These appointments continue the administrations pattern of manipulating Executive authority to avoid having to secure support from Congress. Pro forma sessions were never meant to be a window for the Administration to appoint whomever it likes to powerful government positions. This power grab threatens the role of Congress and raises serious constitutional questions. The House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to determine whether or not the Presidents appointments are constitutional and in the best interests of the American people. Background: On January 4, 2012, the White House appointed four individuals using the recess appointment authority to bypass congressional approval of the nominees. But the Senate, which has the constitutional authority to provide advice and consent on certain presidential appointments was not actually in recess. This intentional attempt to circumvent the authority of the Senate granted by our Founding Fathers poses serious constitutional questions and undermines the validity of the recent appointments. The House Judiciary Committee hearing will examine all of the constitutional questions surrounding these appointments.
01.20.2012	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the following statement in response to the Senate decision to postpone consideration of legislation to help combat online piracy. Chairman Smith: I have heard from the critics and I take seriously their concerns regarding proposed legislation to address the problem of online piracy. It is clear that we need to revisit the approach on how best to address the problem of foreign thieves that steal and sell American inventions and products. The problem of online piracy is too big to ignore. American intellectual property industries provide 19 million high-paying jobs and account for more than 60 percent of U.S. exports. The theft of Americas intellectual property costs the U.S. economy more than $100 billion annually and results in the loss of thousands of American jobs. Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while American innovators and job creators are under attack. The online theft of American intellectual property is no different than the theft of products from a store. It is illegal and the law should be enforced both in the store and online. The Committee will continue work with both copyright owners and Internet companies to develop proposals that combat online piracy and protect Americas intellectual property. We welcome input from all organizations and individuals who have an honest difference of opinion about how best to address this widespread problem. The Committee remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American intellectual property and innovation. The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution.
12.07.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was honored at an event last night in Washington, D.C. for his efforts to enact patent reform legislation in 2011. Chairman Smith was named a Policymaker of the Year in Technology for his work on the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249), a bill that updates Americas patent system to encourage innovation, job creation and economic growth. Congressman Smith is one of two members of the House of Representatives to receive the award from POLITICO, a national publication covering Capitol Hill. Other policymakers honored at the event included EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, Policymaker of the Year in Energy; and Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), Policymaker of the Year in Health Care. Sponsored by Chairman Smith and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the America Invents Act is the only major tech legislation to become law in 2011. The bill was approved by both the House of Representatives and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Obama on September 16, 2011. Congressman Smith has led efforts in Congress on patent reform for more than six years. Chairman Smith: The enactment of the America Invents Act is a victory for Americas innovators and job creators who rely on our patent system to develop new products. This bill brings our patent system into the 21st century, reduces frivolous litigation and streamlines the approval of patents. These reforms will help the innovators and job creators of today launch the products and businesses of tomorrow. POLITICO issued the following statement regarding Chairman Smith and Chairman Leahys work on patent reform: If politics is truly ˜the art of the possible, then Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith made art out of politics this year by shepherding through the first major patent reform law in six decades. The Vermont Democrat and the Texas Republican faced some steep odds: a bitterly divided Congress, jurisdictional concerns of competing committees and disputes between the pharmaceutical and tech lobbies. But in the end, their America Invents Act became the only major piece of tech legislation passed in 2011 ” and offered proof that a bipartisan approach to legislation can still work. The America Invents Act implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to eliminate bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. The new law is supported by many national organizations and businesses. The full list is available here.

12.02.2011	The House of Representatives today passed legislation to provide urgently needed help to small businesses by a vote of 263-159. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2011 (H.R. 527) requires agencies to identify the costs new regulations could impose on small businesses and to write the regulations in ways that reduce those costs. It also gives small businesses more opportunities to be heard as regulations are written and forces agencies to look at ways to cut the costs of regulations already on the books. The bill is sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and has 26 cosponsors. Chairman Smith: Job creation is the key to economic recovery and small businesses are Americas main job creators. We should be encouraging businesses to expand, not tying them up with red tape. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act responds to the Administrations words about the need to protect small businesses from over-regulation. The bill makes carefully targeted reforms to the current law to ensure that agencies properly analyze how a new regulation will affect small businesses before adopting that regulation. In the current economic climate, with millions of Americans looking for work, regulatory agencies have no margin of error. We simply cannot afford to over-burden small businesses with more wasteful or inefficient regulations. This bill recognizes that economic growth ultimately depends on job creators”not regulators. It has been 15 years since Congress last updated the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. Experience during that time and the current economic climate reveal that further reforms are necessary. For example, current law allows an agency to avoid preparing a regulatory flexibility analysis if the agency head certifies that the new rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. But these terms are not defined in the law and agencies routinely take advantage of this and fail to prepare any analysis. H.R. 527 requires the Small Business Administration to define these terms uniformly for all agencies, requires agencies to document all economic impacts “ direct and indirect “ that a new regulation could have on small businesses, and assures that small businesses will have a voice in the regulatory process.
12.02.2011	The House of Representatives today passed legislation to reform the federal regulatory process and reduce unnecessary burdens on job creators by a vote of 253-167. The Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 3010), places permanent restrictions on regulatory agencies and restores accountability by requiring openness and transparency in the regulatory process. The bipartisan, bicameral effort is the first of its kind in more than a decade to reform and minimize regulations that stifle economic growth. H.R. 3010 is sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee Chairman Howard Coble (R-N.C.), and Representative Collin Peterson (D-Minn.). Senate companion legislation was introduced by Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.). Chairman Smith: Government regulation has become a barrier to economic growth and job creation. According to the Small Business Administration, regulations cost the American economy $1.75 trillion annually. And the Obama administration only seeks to add billions more to the cost. By its own admission, the Administrations 2011 regulatory agenda contains 200 regulations that typically will affect the economy by $100 million or more per year. Faced with huge new regulatory burdens and uncertainties about what will come next, employers slow down hiring, stop investing and wait for a bill. Government should lift the burden on small businesses, not weigh them down with more regulations. The Regulatory Accountability Act will help free up small businesses and employers to spend more, invest more, and produce more to create more jobs for American workers. For decades, presidents of both parties have issued executive orders to produce less burdensome regulations. This bill makes the principles of those bipartisan directives permanent, enforceable, and applicable to all regulatory agencies, including independent agencies. The Regulatory Accountability Act requires agencies to tailor new regulations to impose the least cost necessary to achieve policy goals set out by Congress. And the bill requires agencies to hold formal hearings to test the assumptions and evidence on which the costliest new rules are based. This is the second bill considered by the House this week to help reduce the regulatory burden on Americas job creators. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) passed the House on Thursday by a vote of 263-159. The bill requires federal agencies to identify and reduce the costs new regulations would impose on small businesses.

11.30.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith met today with members of the Texas National Guards 36th Infantry Division, who recently returned from a year-long tour in Southern Iraq. Members of the division shared their observations on the current situation in Iraq and National Guard operations and deployments. Brigadier General William Smith, who serves as Commander of Domestic Operations for the Joint Forces Headquarter of Texas, is a constituent of Congressman Smiths in the 21st district. The men and women of the Texas National Guard 36th Infantry Division deserve our deep gratitude for their service to our nation, said Smith. As President Obama withdraws our troops from Iraq, it is critical to hear their perspective on the capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces and Irans influence in spurring insurgency there. As our brave military members return home, we must work to ensure that they receive our full support and that their gains in Iraq are not reversed. Also this week, the House passed the National Guard and Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act to help members of the National Guard and Reserve obtain bankruptcy relief if needed. The measure was approved by the House Judiciary Committee, which Smith chairs, in September.
11.21.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement today regarding the announcement that the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction has failed to reach an agreement. Its disappointing that the members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction werent able to reach an agreement. I know that my Republican colleagues negotiated in good faith and did everything possible to reach the Committees goal. Republicans on the Committee did not support tax increases, which would make our economy worse, but they were willing to consider new tax revenue as long as it was through reforms that would make the tax code more fair and competitive. Unfortunately, Democrats on the Committee insisted on tax increases and did not put forth a plan to seriously address rising health care costs. A majority of House Democrats also recently voted against a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which would impose the fiscal restraint necessary to rein in federal spending. President Obama and Congressional Democrats would rather continue the policies that have led us to a $15 trillion national debt and an unemployment rate that continues to hover above 9 percent.
11.16.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in support of a bill that recognizes the importance of the Second Amendment and makes it easier for individuals with concealed carry permits to carry a firearm in other states. H.R. 822, the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011, allows law-abiding gun owners with valid state-issued concealed firearm permits to carry a concealed firearm in other states that also allow concealed carry. The bill passed by a vote of 272 to 153. Similar to how states recognize drivers licenses issued by other states, H.R. 822 requires states that currently allow people to carry concealed firearms to recognize other states valid concealed carry permits. Congressman Smith, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee and managed the debate on the House floor, urged his colleagues to support the bill. Chairman Smith: The Second Amendment is a fundamental right to bear arms that should not be constrained by state boundary lines. This legislation enhances public safety and protects the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. Studies show that carrying concealed weapons reduces violent crime rates by deterring would-be assailants and by allowing law-abiding citizens to defend themselves. Data from the FBIs Annual Uniform Crime Report shows that ˜right-to-carry states, or those that widely allow concealed carry, have 22% lower total violent crime rates, 30% lower murder rates, 46% lower robbery rates, and 12% lower aggravated assault rates, as compared to the rest of the country. This bill simply allows Americans who travel in interstate commerce to bring their Second Amendment rights with them. Forty-nine states allow concealed carry permits, and 40 of these extend some degree of reciprocity to permit holders from other states. This bill simply applies the states reciprocal agreements nationwide. H.R. 822 recognizes the right of states to determine eligibility requirements for their own residents. State, local and federal laws and regulations regarding how, when, and where a concealed firearm can be carried that apply to a resident will apply equally to a non-resident. The bill requires a person to show both a valid government-issued identification document, such as a license or permit, and a valid concealed carry license or permit. H.R. 822 only applies to states that allow concealed carry. States that prohibit the concealed carrying of firearms are not affected by this legislation. The National Rifle Association supports this bill.
11.11.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement for Veterans Day on November 11th: Today we honor all the veterans, past and present, who have served our country and defended our nations freedoms. America is a stronger country because of the sacrifice our veterans made for us. Veterans Day is also a day to remember those who never returned home. The debt that we owe our brave men and women in uniform can never fully be repaid. Veterans Day is a reminder of our commitment to them, but more than a symbolic gesture, we need to work to help veterans throughout the year. Recently the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Veterans Opportunity to Work Act, which I cosponsored, to provide tax incentives to employers who hire veterans. Last week, the House of Representatives voted to ensure benefit payments to veterans keep track with higher costs of living. In Washington, we are pushing for funding for medical research and to create better access for veterans to health care provided at Fort Sam Houston and other facilities in Texas Hill Country. Our commitment to our veterans is not something to remember only one day a year, but a commitment which lasts a lifetime. Information on federal benefits for veterans is available here. If my office can ever be of assistance regarding questions or concerns with your veterans benefits, please contact my San Antonio office at 210-821-5024. Thank you for your service.
11.09.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith hosted a job fair today, in cooperation with Workforce Solutions Alamo, with 96 employers participating and over 1,000 people attending. The job fair was hugely successful with great participation from both employers and local job seekers, said Smith. We were able to help match many 21st district residents looking for work with job creators ready to hire. With San Antonios unemployment rate at a 21 year high, I believe this job fair was helpful to many unemployed residents. Thanks to all the employers who participated in the job fair and helped make it a success. Events like this are a good start to help put people back to work. I will continue working in Congress to advance legislation to put the governments economic house back in order and create more jobs for Americans. Click here for a full list of employers who participated in the job fair.
11.07.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today presented Megan Abbott with the Congressional Award Gold Medal for her efforts to improve her community and achieve her personal development goals. Megan, who is from Fair Oaks Ranch and currently a student at Texas Military Institute, volunteered over 400 hours at the Cibolo Nature Center. Megan has earned this award through her dedication to helping others in her community, said Smith. This is a very high honor for a young person to earn and she has set an admirable example of service for all of us. Megan has a very bright future and Im pleased to present her with this gold medal in recognition of her outstanding achievement. The Congressional Award program is a non-partisan partnership between Congress and the private sector. The Congressional Award is open to all young Americans ages 14-23. To earn the Award, young people must set and achieve goals in the four program areas: voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness and expedition/exploration. More information is available at www.congressionalaward.org.
11.03.2011	The House Judiciary Committee today passed a bipartisan bill to reform the federal regulatory process and reduce unnecessary burdens on job creators. The bill is sponsored by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. The Regulatory Accountability Act requires agencies to assess the costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives and, in most cases, to adopt the least-costly alternative to achieve the regulatory objectives of Congress. The Act places permanent restrictions on regulatory agencies and restores accountability by requiring openness and transparency in the regulatory process. The bill passed by a vote of 16-6. Chairman Smith: Government regulation has become a barrier to economic growth and job creation. Federal regulations cost our economy $1.75 trillion each year. And the Obama administration seeks to add billions more to the cost. By its own admission, the administration is preparing 200 regulations that each will affect the economy by $100 million or more. Faced with huge new regulatory burdens and uncertainties about what will come next, employers slow down hiring, stop investing and wait for a bill. We need to encourage businesses to expand, not tie them up with red tape. The Regulatory Accountability Act will help lift the regulatory burden and free up small businesses and employers to spend more, invest more, and produce more to create more jobs for American workers. For decades, presidents of both parties have issued executive orders to produce less burdensome regulations. This bill makes the principles of those bipartisan directives permanent, enforceable and applicable to all regulatory agencies, including independent agencies. The Regulatory Accountability Act requires agencies to tailor new regulations to impose the least cost necessary to achieve policy goals set out by Congress. And the bill requires agencies to hold formal hearings to test the assumptions and evidence on which the costliest new rules are based. This bipartisan, bicameral effort is the first of its kind in more than a decade to reform and minimize regulations that stifle economic growth. The bill has 24 cosponsors. The Regulatory Accountability Act is part of the House Judiciary Committees agenda to restore regulatory accountability. Under Chairman Smiths leadership, the Committee has approved two additional bills to rein in federal regulations. The REINS Act (H.R. 10) requires congressional approval for government regulations that have an economic impact of at least $100 million. The Committee approved H.R. 10 in October by a vote of 22-14. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) requires federal agencies to identify and reduce the costs new regulations would impose on small businesses. The Committee approved H.R. 527 in July by a vote of 18-8.
11.02.2011	The Immigration Subcommittee today voted to authorize House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) to issue a subpoena to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for a list of illegal and criminal immigrants the agency has declined to detain or place in removal proceedings. Chairman Smith asked for this information in August. But to date, DHS has not provided the requested information. The Immigration Subcommittee voted 7-4 to authorize the subpoena. Chairman Smith plans to issue the subpoena this week. Chairman Smith: Over two months ago, I sent DHS a written request for information about removable illegal and criminal immigrants who have not been detained or placed in removal proceedings. The Administration is obviously not acting in good faith and is wrongfully trying to keep crucial information from the American people. They are on the verge of obstructing the legitimate role of Congress. Why does DHS want to hide this information? Why wont they provide Congress with these documents? Are administration officials afraid that the information will show that illegal immigrants intentionally released by ICE have committed crimes that could have been prevented? The American people have a right to know what crimes these 300,000 illegal immigrants committed after ICE intentionally chose not to detain them. The Administration has a decision to make: will they be open and honest or will they continue to hide information crucial to the health and safety of the American people? On August 22, 2011, Chairman Smith wrote to DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano requesting a list of the criminal immigrants flagged by Secure Communities but intentionally have not been removed. DHS originally stated they would be able to provide the information, but to date DHS has not given Chairman Smith the list as promised. Instead, DHS only provided general information on the Secure Communities program. Last week, Secretary Napolitano testified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding DHS oversight. During the hearing, Chairman Smith again requested the information and gave DHS a deadline for Monday, October 31 by 10:00 a.m. Chairman Smith stated if the information was not provided by DHS, he would have no choice but to issue a subpoena. To read the letters, visit https://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Letters%20to%20and%20from%20DHS.pdf Background on Secure Communities: The Secure Communities program keeps our neighborhoods safe by identifying illegal and criminal immigrants in police custody who have been arrested and fingerprinted. But the Obama administration recently made changes to Secure Communities that could open the door to allow millions of illegal and criminal immigrants to avoid current immigration laws. Specifically, the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued two memos to agency officials on how to exercise blanket prosecutorial discretion, such as granting deferred action, deciding whom to stop, question, arrest, or detain, and dismissing a removal proceeding. While this authority is justifiable when exercised responsibly, the Obama administration has used it recklessly. DHS officials also recently announced that its newly created working group will begin a case-by-case review of illegal immigrants in removal proceedings and with a final order of removal to determine if those individuals should be removed at the agencys discretion.
10.26.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith has held two telephone town meetings with thousands of Bexar County constituents. He uses the technology, also known as a tele-town hall, to stay in touch with constituents when he is in Washington for votes. Congressman Smith: Through tele-town hall meetings, I hear from constituents about issues that concern them and respond to their questions and comments. During the telephone calls, I also poll constituents about various issues. For example, more than 73% of callers felt that the best way to reduce the deficit is to cut federal spending. Communicating regularly with constituents helps me better represent them in Washington. I appreciate their participation in the tele-town meetings. During the call, Congressman Smith asked three poll questions. The results were tabulated by the tele-town meeting technology. Do you support legislation that would require congressional approval for major regulations? 1) Yes “ 71% 2) No “ 15% 3) Undecided “ 14% Which of these ideas would be the most effective at creating jobs? 1) Reducing taxes- 25% 2) Elimination regulations- 39% 3) Enforcing worksite immigration laws - 28% 4) Undecided “ 8% What is the best way to reduce the deficit? 1) Raise Taxes- 4% 2) Cut Spending - 73% 3) Raise taxes and cut spending- 22% 4) Undecided “ 1% For more information about how you can contact Congressman Smith and participate in future tele-town hall meetings, please visit: https://lamarsmith.house.gov/
10.25.2011	The House Judiciary Committee today passed a bill to restore accountability to government regulations. Sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Congressman Geoff Davis (R-Ky.), the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 10) requires Congress to take an up-or-down vote on government regulations before they can be enforced on the American people and businesses. Specifically, the bill authorizes Congress to vote on regulations that will have an economic impact of at least $100 million or major increases in costs or prices for consumers. The bill passed along party lines by a vote of 22-14. Chairman Smith: The American people have been hit by an onslaught of unnecessary federal regulations. As of 2008, federal regulations cost our economy $1.75 trillion each year. And by its own admission, the Obama Administration is preparing numerous regulations that each will cost the economy $1 billion or more per year. Employers are rightly concerned about the costs these regulations will impose on their businesses. So they stop hiring, stop spending and start saving for a bill from Big Brother. The REINS Act reins in the costly overreach of federal agencies that stifles job creation and hinders economic growth. It restores the authority to impose regulations to those who are accountable to the voters, their elected representatives in Congress. Rep. Davis: I am very glad that the REINS Act has now been favorably reported by the full Judiciary Committee and we are one step closer to restoring accountability and transparency to the regulatory process. I thank Chairman Lamar Smith and Chairman Howard Coble for seeing the bill through the Judiciary Committees mark-up, and I look forward to continue working with them and all of my colleagues to pass this commonsense bill into law. For more information about the REINS Act, visit: https://geoffdavis.house.gov/REINS/
10.17.2011	Congressman Smith will hold three public meetings this week with constituents in the 21st district.Wednesday, October 19th10 a.m.: Kerrville Public Meeting Location: Kathleen C. Cailloux Theater - 910 Main Street, Kerrville TX 3 p.m.: Bandera Public Meeting Location: Bandera Justice Center, 3360 State Highway 173 North, Bandera, TX Thursday, October 20th 9 a.m: New Braunfels Public Meeting Location: McKenna Events Center, 801 West San Antonio, New Braunfels, TX
10.12.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement in support of the Free Trade Agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. The agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea are jobs bills that will immediately help our economy and create opportunities for American businesses to grow. These three agreements could help create 250,000 American jobs and boost our gross domestic product by over $10 billion “without increasing government spending. In the 21st district there are over 47,000 jobs directly supported by exports, according to the Chamber of Commerce. I support the trade agreements to increase competitiveness for American manufacturers.
10.06.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith, the vice-chair of the Space & Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, today called for NASAs inspector general to investigate the politicization of the agency. This stems from a NASA-internal report showing that Obama Administration political appointees focus on Democratic political goals, not national goals, creating a dysfunctional and hostile work environment for NASAs career civil servants. I am disturbed by the findings in this report, as scientific and technical agencies like NASA need to work freely of political ideology to the greatest extent possible. We should not play partisan politics with our nations space program. I am calling for an investigation to see if any improper actions have been taken to steer agency funding and contracts, circumvent the civil service hiring process, or if other mismanagement of agency resources has occurred to benefit ˜Democratic political goals. NASA represents the best of Americas ingenuity, exploration and discovery. As Neil Armstrong testified before the Science Committee two weeks ago, the current condition of NASAs manned spaceflight program is ˜lamentably embarrassing and unacceptable, and this internal NASA study provides disturbing insights into the tension between NASAs senior career managers and Obama Administration political appointees. All of NASA should be working together to strengthen our space program and bolster Americas human space exploration. Smith asked that a report on the investigations findings be submitted to the Science Committee within four months.
10.04.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate whether comments made by Attorney General Eric Holder during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in May 2011 were truthful. In a letter to President Obama, Chairman Smith expressed concern that Members of Congress may have been misled by the Attorney Generals response to a question regarding his knowledge of the Fast and Furious program. The Attorney General stated that he first heard of the program in the weeks leading up to the May 2011 hearing. But documents released on Friday night raise significant questions about the truthfulness of the Attorney Generals testimony. Chairman Smith: The Departments consistent response to Congress has been that Operation Fast and Furious was a discrete law enforcement effort largely isolated to the ATF office in Phoenix. These documents appear to undermine this claim and bring into question statements made by Attorney General Holder to this Committee. Allegations that senior Justice Department officials may have intentionally misled Members of Congress are extremely troubling and must be addressed by an independent and objective special counsel. I urge you to appoint a special counsel who will investigate these allegations as soon as possible. The full text of the letter from Chairman Smith can be found at: https://judiciary.house.gov/news/pdfs/Special%20Counsel%20for%20Fast%20and%20Furious.pdf
09.22.2011	A bipartisan, bicameral group in Congress today unveiled a plan to significantly reform the federal regulatory process and reduce unnecessary burdens on job creators. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee Chairman Howard Coble (R-N.C.) and Representative Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) were joined by Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) in introducing the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2011. The bill reforms the current rulemaking process to lower the costs and improve the quality of new regulations. This bipartisan, bicameral effort is the first of its kind in more than a decade to reform and minimize regulations that stifle economic growth. Chairman Smith: The current regulatory system has become a barrier to economic growth and job creation. Federal regulations cost our economy $1.75 trillion each year. Employers are rightly concerned about the costs these regulations will impose on their businesses. So they stop hiring, stop spending and start saving for a bill from Big Brother. But rather than burdening businesses with more regulations, we need to free up employers so they can create jobs for American workers. The Regulatory Accountability Act does just that. It places permanent restrictions on regulatory agencies and restores accountability by requiring openness and transparency in the regulatory process. This is a bipartisan, bicameral bill that both parties, both houses of Congress and the President should support. Representative Peterson: While it is difficult to enact a new law, its even harder to get a regulation written correctly. In many cases, interest groups try to use regulation to interpret the law in their best interest, instead of following the intent of the law. By bringing transparency and accountability to the regulatory process, the American people will be allowed to have a voice in these policy decisions. Representative Coble: This bill will help ensure that future regulations are based on the best available scientific information and that they are efficient. Many of the regulations being issued are founded on questionable basis and they disregard less costly alternatives. This legislation does not affect the what-is, it addresses the what-will-be and should be embraced by everyone. Senator Portman: One of the most frequent concerns I hear from employers throughout Ohio is that mounting regulatory burdens impede growth and increase the costs of doing business. This common-sense, bipartisan legislation will cut back on unnecessary red tape by building economic reality-checks into every step of the regulatory process. Its an immediate step Washington can take to help unleash the forces of job creation again in America. Senator Pryor: We need a 21st Century regulatory system that promotes growth, innovation and job creation. By ensuring all parties have a seat at the table at the beginning of the process, this legislation prevents overly burdensome and drawn-out regulations from interfering with our nations prosperity. For decades, presidents of both parties have issued executive orders to produce more sensible, less burdensome regulations. This bill makes the principles of those bipartisan directives permanent, enforceable, and applicable to all regulatory agencies, including independent agencies. The Act also requires agencies to tailor new regulations to impose the least cost necessary to achieve policy goals set out by Congress. Finally, the bill requires agencies to hold formal hearings to test the assumptions and evidence on which the costliest new rules are based.

09.16.2011	President Obama today signed into law the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (H.R. 1249) a bipartisan, bicameral bill that updates our patent system to encourage innovation, job creation and economic growth. Both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly supported the proposal, which was sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas). The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1249 by a vote of 304-117 earlier this year. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 89-9. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) partnered with Chairman Smith on the legislation. Congressman Smith led the House efforts on patent reform for more than six years. Much-needed reforms to our patent system are long overdue. The last major patent reform was nearly 60 years ago. The House patent reform bill implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to weed out bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. This bill is supported by local companies as well as many national organizations and businesses. The full list is available here. Chairman Smith (R-Texas): “The America Invents Act is one of the most significant job creation bills enacted by Congress this year. Our outdated patent system has been a barrier to innovation, unnecessarily delaying American inventors from marketing new products and creating jobs for American workers. It takes over three years to get a patent approved in the U.S. American innovators are forced to wait years before they can hire workers and market their inventions. “The enactment of H.R. 1249 is a victory for America’s innovators and job creators who rely on our patent system to develop new products and grow their businesses. The America Invents Act brings our patent system into the 21st century, reducing frivolous litigation while creating a more efficient process for the approval of patents. These reforms will help the innovators and job creators of today launch the products and businesses of tomorrow.” For more information about the America Invents Act please visit: https://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issues_patentreformact2011.html
09.09.2011	Ten years ago a foreign enemy attacked us on our own soil. On that fateful day in September, thousands of innocent Americans lost their lives. As we reflect on the ten year anniversary, we can recall what it felt like to watch the horrific events of that day unfold. As I drove to work on September 11, 2001, I remember that the sky was clear that morning and the windows in my car were rolled down because the air conditioning system was broken. When I passed the Pentagon on my right, I heard a muffled noise that caused me to turn and look. I saw black smoke rising up and I remember thinking to myself that the smoke appeared to be very close to the Pentagon. I was also concerned because the smoke was black. When paper or wood is being burned the smoke is lighter, but this smoke was thick, black and looked like a chemical fire. About five minutes later I pulled into the Rayburn House Office Building where my office is located, and a Capitol Police Officer told me that the Pentagon had just been hit. I realized then that I had witnessed one of the attacks on our homeland. Later that year, I was personally involved in our efforts to prevent future attacks on America. I was a member of the Judiciary Committee, which I now chair, when it approved the PATRIOT Act. Ten years later, the terrorist threat facing America has changed but has not diminished. This important act has helped keep us safe from terrorist attacks. The PATRIOT Act continues to play a vital role in Americas counter-terrorism efforts, not only to prevent another large-scale attack, but also to combat an increasing number of smaller terrorist plots. America is fortunate not to have suffered another attack of such magnitude and devastation in the past decade. But it is not because terrorists havent tried. There have been numerous attempts by terrorists to kill innocent Americans. We must beware the folly of complacency. We cannot afford to leave our intelligence community without the reliable resources it needs to dismantle terrorist organizations, identify threats from both groups and individuals, and interrupt terrorist plots of all sizes. Today as we honor those who died on September 11th and stand with their families, we continue working to ensure that this never happens again. September 11 may have shattered our sense of safety, but it has also strengthened our resolve, national pride and preparedness.
09.08.2011	The Senate today passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (H.R. 1249), a bipartisan, bicameral bill that updates our patent system to encourage innovation, job creation and economic growth. The Senate passed the bill today by a vote of 89-9. The House overwhelmingly approved H.R. 1249 by a vote of 304-117 earlier this year. Much-needed reforms to our patent system are long overdue. The last major patent reform was nearly 60 years ago. The House patent reform bill implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to weed out bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has led the effort on patent reform for six years. Chairman Smith (R-Texas): After more than six years of bipartisan efforts and negotiations, we have crossed the finish line on patent reform. Todays vote is a victory for Americas innovators and job creators who rely on our patent system to develop new products and grow their businesses. These reforms constitute the most significant change to U.S. patent law in 175 years, since the Patent Act of 1836. And when President Obama signs the bill into law, H.R. 1249 will be one of the most significant jobs creation bills enacted by Congress this year. The America Invents Act creates a better patent system for inventors and innovative industries. I thank Chairman Leahy for working with me to improve and turn around the House patent reform bill. This is a true example of bipartisan success that will benefit the American people. Six years ago, industry leaders and American inventors came to Congress saying that the current patent system had become a barrier to the very innovation that drives our economy. The average wait time for patent approval in the U.S. is three years. The PTO has a backlog of 1.2 million patents pending approval. Time is money in America, and even more so for innovators who are forced to wait years before they can market and distribute their inventions. This puts American innovators at a competitive disadvantage in a global marketplace. H.R. 1249 brings our patent system into the 21st century, reducing frivolous litigation while creating a more efficient process for the approval of patents. These reforms will help the innovators and job creators of today launch the products and businesses of tomorrow. Chairman Leahy (D-Vt.): The America Invents Act is a true jobs bill at a time when we need it the most. After six long years of debate spanning three Congresses and two administrations, it is finally set to become law. This is bipartisan, commonsense legislation that will spur the innovation that drives the American economy. Chairman Smith has been a true partner in our joint effort to enact meaningful patent reform legislation. I have been grateful for his partnership and support, and commend his work in the House to move this bill forward. I commend Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, and Senator Kyl for their commitment to this important bill. The America Invents Act shows what we can accomplish when we cast aside political ideology, and work together for the American people. The creativity that drives our economic engine has made America the global leader in invention and innovation. The America Invents Act will ensure that inventors large and small maintain the competitive edge that has put America at the pinnacle of global innovation. This is historic legislation. It is good policy. And it is long overdue to be signed into law. IP Subcommittee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.): The last time our patent laws were significantly updated was in 1952. The nature of our economy has changed significantly since then, and it is only right that Congress review our patent laws and amend them as necessary to make sure they still work efficiently to promote progress and innovation as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. The America Invents Act creates more certainty about patent rights, which will attract investment in these ideas. This will unleash further innovation in America by ensuring that more products and services come to market which will help put Americans back to work.

09.08.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued this response to the Presidents joint address to Congress on September 8. In his address to Congress, the President had an opportunity to present a new, badly-needed plan to put more Americans back to work. Instead, we heard him call for another stimulus bill, which will be paid for by future tax hikes. Tax increases have never created one job, and the threat of tax hikes in the future only adds to the uncertainty that keeps businesses from hiring. We know what will help create jobs in this country “lifting the burden of regulations that is strangling small businesses. In 2011, the Obama administration is expected to propose over 200 regulations costing over $100 million each. Seven of those new regulations would cost the economy more than $1 billion each. Small business owners bear the brunt of these excessive regulations. The Presidents policies have not worked. He proposed one stimulus plan costing over $800 billion and unemployment went up, not down. To help our economy recover we must work together to reduce the regulatory burdens that are discouraging job creators from making new investments and creating jobs.
09.07.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called on President Obama to exercise regulatory restraint in order to protect small businesses and Americas job creators from the growing costs of federal regulations. Chairman Smith: As President Obama prepares for his speech on the state of the economy, he should consider the burden his Administrations regulations have imposed on American businesses. A recent Heritage Foundation study reported that in his first two years in office, President Obama imposed 75 new major rules costing the private sector more than $40 billion. And more than 4,200 new regulations are in the pipeline. Uncertainty about the cost of these upcoming regulations discourages employers from hiring new employees and expanding their businesses. More rules and regulations will not help with job creation. According to the Small Business Administration, federal regulations cost our economy $1.75 trillion per year. Thats money that should be going toward new products, innovations, business expansion and job creation. Instead of practicing for another public speech, the President should learn to practice regulatory restraint. Reducing the regulatory burden on businesses is a priority for the House Judiciary Committee. The REINS Act (H.R. 10) requires congressional approval for any regulation with an economic impact of at least $100 million before it can be imposed on American businesses. The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) requires federal agencies to identify and reduce the costs new regulations could impose on small businesses. And the Committee is planning to introduce new legislation to lower the costs of regulations on all businesses and provide more transparency to the regulatory process. Each of these bills is a step in the right direction for the economy, small businesses and Americas job creators.
08.03.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that registration is open for the US Cyber Challenge Fall competition, a national contest for high school students interested in pursuing advanced education and job opportunities in the cyber security field. This is a great opportunity for high school students who want to pursue an education in the cyber security field, said Smith. This rapidly-growing field is critical to help our nation meet the challenges of the 21st century. There are few things more valuable to an individual than a good education and few things more valuable to a community than educated residents. I encourage all students who are interested to apply for this competition. Participation is available to all U.S. high school students in both public and private schools, as well as to students who are home schooled or involved in other organized groups. Students may register individually or as a group through their schools. Teachers, principals and school administrators are encouraged to facilitate their students participation. Registration is open until September 30 and is available at USCC: www.uscyberchallenge.org
08.01.2011	Smith Supports Significant Spending Cuts Washington, D.C. “ Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the following statement regarding the House of Representatives passage of legislation that cuts federal spending by more than the debt ceiling is increased. The bill also advances efforts by Republicans to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution that makes permanent cuts to federal spending that cannot be undone by future congresses. Congressman Smith is a co-sponsor of H.J. Res. 1, the Balanced Budget Amendment. Congressman Smith: I support this legislation because it keeps the two promises Republicans made to the American people: it cuts spending by more than it raises the debt ceiling and it doesnt raise taxes. Tax increases have never created one job “ unless you count the IRS in Washington. This bill cuts federal spending by as much as $2.4 trillion over the next ten years. It also requires both the House and Senate to take an up-or-down vote on a balanced budget amendment that would prevent future congresses from undoing much-needed spending cuts. The big government, big spending policies of the Obama administration are bankrupting our nation. Under President Obama, federal spending has increased 16% in just the last two and a half years. That kind of excessive government spending is unsustainable. This is the first step in a long journey, but at least we have turned the corner and are headed in the right direction. We must continue to enact legislation that reduces the deficit, cuts government spending, encourages economic growth and generates jobs for American workers. Our future prosperity as a nation depends on it.
07.29.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith will today vote for the Budget Control Act of 2011. This bill would cut federal spending by more than the debt ceiling is increased. The United States is facing a fiscal crisis, caused by excessive government spending. The federal government is now borrowing 42 cents for every dollar it spends. No family, no community, no business, no country can afford to do that. I have long believed in fiscal responsibility. I was a member of the Budget Committee when we achieved the first balanced budget in over twenty years. I have co-sponsored balanced budget amendments to the Constitution. And I have voted against raising the debt limit in the past. I support this legislation because it meets two important goals “ it cuts spending by more than it raises the debt ceiling and it doesnt raise taxes. Tax increases have never created jobs. This is the first battle in a long war on reckless government spending. We must continue to put restraints on future spending. This bill is a step in the right direction though many more steps are needed. The Budget Control Act of 2011: · Requires the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment before the end of the year. · Saves $917 billion over ten years, and raises the debt ceiling by less “$900 billion. · Includes no tax hikes. · Creates a Joint Committee of Congress that is required to report legislation that would reduce federal spending by another $1.8 trillion over 10 years.
07.18.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today co-sponsored the Cut, Cap and Balance Act. This legislation would enact significant spending cuts, place enforceable caps on government spending and require the passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment in order to raise the debt limit. This legislation would have an immediate impact on our debt crisis by cutting government spending and helping put our fiscal house back in order, said Smith. Our nations $14.3 trillion debt threatens the economic security of future generations. We currently borrow 43 cents for every dollar we spend. This legislation puts measures in place to make immediate cuts and cap future spending. We also need a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget so that we can address the underlying causes of our debt. This legislation tackles all aspects of our out-of-control federal spending and helps secure our economic future. The Cut, Cap and Balance Act cuts total spending by $111 billion in FY 2012, reducing non-defense discretionary spending below 2008 levels. The legislation also puts statutory, enforceable caps into place, bringing spending down to the historic average of 20% of GDP by 2021. And it requires the passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment in order for the debt limit to be raised. Under this legislation, the president can only request a debt ceiling increase if a qualifying Balanced Budget Amendment is passed by Congress and is sent to the states for ratification. In addition, the following groups support Cut, Cap, and Balance: 60 Plus Act for America Adventures into the Constitution America Refocused American Civil Rights Union American Conservative Union American Family Association American Future Fund American Grassroots Coalition American Majority Action Americans for Jobs Security Americans for Limited Government Americans for Prosperity Balanced Budget Amendment Task ForceBasicsProject.org Broke With Hope Campaign for Liberty Can-Do Conservatives Center for Military ReadinessChristian Coalition Citizens Against Government Waste Citizens For Community Values Action Citizens for the Republic Citizens UnitedClub for Growth CNP Action, Inc.

07.14.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) today introduced legislation to prevent forum shopping in chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization cases. The Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Venue Reform Act of 2011 (H.R.2533) requires corporations to file reorganization cases in the judicial district where they have their principal place of business or principal assets rather than in a far away district where they have no employees, assets or connection to the community. Loopholes in the current law allowed Enron, a Houston-based corporation with 7,500 employees in Texas, and General Motors, whose principal assets are in Michigan, to leave their employees and creditors behind and file for bankruptcy in New York City, a venue known for being management-friendly. The bill would amend chapter 11 bankruptcy venue rules to require businesses to reorganize on their home turf to ensure maximum input from all affected stakeholders. Chairman Smith: Ten years ago, the discovery of Enrons massive fraud perpetrated on its shareholders, creditors, and 7,500 Houston-based employees forced the company to file for bankruptcy. But rather than face the music in Texas, Enron filed a chapter 11 case thousands of miles away in New York City, a jurisdiction with a reputation in the bankruptcy community for being management-friendly. Venue shopping for sympathetic courts has become an all-too-common practice for large companies filing for bankruptcy. Unfortunately, it significantly disadvantages displaced employees, creditors and shareholders who should be able to participate in the reorganization negotiations. This legislation reforms the chapter 11 venue rules to prevent corporations from fleeing to friendly jurisdictions for bankruptcy, while leaving employees, creditors and other stakeholders without a voice in the negotiations. Ranking Member Conyers: This long overdue legislation will help level the playing field between employees and management in corporate chapter 11 bankruptcy cases and restore fairness. Under current law, the very same management that drove the business into financial distress can retain control of the business by choosing to file the chapter 11 bankruptcy case in a management-friendly venue. This bill will limit bankruptcy filing venue options to where the principal place of business or assets of the debtor are located, which typically will be where most of the debtors employees are located. As a result, employees will now have a greater ability to protect their interests and to make their concerns known to the bankruptcy court without having to be forced to do so in distant venues. Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee Chairman Howard Coble (R-N.C.) and Ranking Member Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) joined as original cosponsors of H.R. 2533.
07.13.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith recently held two telephone town meetings with his constituents in Bandera, Blanco, Comal, Kendall, Kerr and Real counties. Smith uses tele-town meetings, to stay in touch with constituents when he is in Washington for votes. My constituents participation has been tremendous, said Smith. Through this forum I can reach out to people in the comfort of their own homes, hear from them on issues they care about and respond to their questions. Its one of the best ways I can stay in touch with my constituents. And it helps me to do my job better. Over 1,500 residents of the Hill Country participated in the two one-hour telephone meetings. Smith also asked three poll questions, with the results tabulated by the tele-town meeting technology: 1) Do you believe the federal government is doing enough to secure our borders? 5% believe the federal government is doing enough to secure our borders. 91% believe the federal government is not doing enough to secure our borders. 4% were undecided. 2) What do you think is the best way to create jobs? 4% believe it is to increase government spending. 89% believe it is to reduce taxes and spending. 7% were undecided. 3) What steps should Congress take to reduce the deficit? 80% believe that Congress should reduce spending. 3% believe that Congress should increase taxes. 17% believe that Congress should both increase taxes and reduce spending.
07.11.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized the Obama administrations decision to impose new reporting requirements for gun sales in states along the U.S.-Mexico Border. Chairman Smith: Todays announcement follows months of controversy over the ATFs Fast and Furious program that allowed guns to be trafficked into Mexico without any way of preventing the guns from being used for illegal activity. One of the guns was used in the shooting death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. It is the height of hypocrisy for the Obama administration to restrict the gun rights of border state citizens, when the administration itself knowingly and intentionally allowed guns to be trafficked into Mexico. Limiting the second amendment rights of law abiding citizens is not going to solve the problem of guns being trafficked into Mexico. An additional reporting requirement wont stop drug cartels from getting weapons. This rule unfairly punishes citizens in Border States who have the right to purchase firearms to protect themselves and their families from dangerous drug traffickers and human smugglers. A recent GAO report found that only 44% of the Southwest border is under operational control of the Border Patrol. Forty-four percent is a failing grade. If the Obama administration is serious about preventing guns from being trafficked to Mexico, they simply need to secure the Southwest border, not restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens.
07.07.2011	The House Judiciary Committee today approved legislation to reduce frivolous lawsuits that plague our legal system and restore sanctions against attorneys who file meritless suits in federal court. The Committee favorably reported H.R. 966, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (LARA), by a vote of 20-13. Federal rules mandating sanctions for frivolous suits were watered down in 1993, resulting in the current crisis of widespread lawsuit abuse. LARA restores accountability for attorneys by reinstating monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous suits. Chairman Smith: The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act is just over a page long, but it would prevent the filing of hundreds of thousands of pages of frivolous legal pleadings in federal court. Lawsuit abuse has become too common in American society partly because the lawyers who bring these cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Plaintiffs lawyers can file frivolous suits, no matter how absurd the claims, without any penalty. Meanwhile defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys fees or a settlement. Many of these cases have cost innocent people and business owners their reputations and hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by reinstating mandatory sanctions for attorneys who file meritless suits. Though LARA will not stop all lawsuit abuse, it encourages attorneys to think twice before filing a frivolous lawsuit. LARA takes three strong steps to help thwart frivolous lawsuits: · Reinstates the requirement that if there is a violation of Rule 11, there are sanctions (Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was originally intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party). · Requires that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits. Those monetary sanctions will include the attorneys fees and costs incurred by the victim of the frivolous lawsuit. · Reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow parties and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims by withdrawing them within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been served.
06.23.2011	The House of Representatives today adopted a managers amendment to H.R. 1249, the America Invents Act, a bill that makes much-needed reforms to our patent system. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) offered the managers amendment as part of an agreement with the Appropriations Committee over language addressing fee diversion. Since 1992, nearly $1 billion has been diverted from the PTO. The average wait time for patent approval is three years. The Managers Amendment ends fee diversion by creating a fund for fees collected by the PTO. The money in the fund will be reserved for and used by the PTO and only the PTO. This maintains congressional oversight, while making sure that fees collected by the PTO can no longer be diverted. The House approved the provision by a vote of 283-140. The House is expected to vote on H.R. 1249 later this week. Chairman Smith praised the House vote and urged passage of the America Invents Act. Chairman Smith: I am pleased that the House has overwhelmingly adopted the managers amendment to the America Invents Act. The large margins of this vote demonstrate that Congress understands the importance of patent reform to maintaining Americas global competitiveness, growing our economy, and generating jobs for American workers. After six years of working towards patent reform, we are near the finish line. The current patent system is outdated and has become a barrier to innovation and job creation. The average wait time for patent approval is three years. The America Invents Act creates a faster and more efficient process for the approval of good patents. That means more products for American consumers and more jobs for American workers. If Congress is serious about economic growth and job creation, we must pass patent reform. Much-needed reforms to our patent system are long overdue. The last major patent reform was nearly 60 years ago. H.R. 1249, the America Invents Act, implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to weed out bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. H.R. 1249 was approved by the House Judiciary Committee by a vote of 32-3. Similar legislation passed the Senate with overwhelming support by a vote of 95-5. The bill enjoys broad support from industry leaders, academic institutions and independent inventors.

06.23.2011	The House of Representatives today passed a bill sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) that updates our patent system to encourage innovation, job creation and economic growth. Much-needed reforms to our patent system are long overdue. The last major patent reform was nearly 60 years ago. H.R. 1249, the America Invents Act, implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to weed out bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. The House overwhelmingly approved the bill by a vote of 304-117. Chairman Smith: Todays vote is a victory for Americas innovators and job creators who rely on our patent system to develop new products and grow their businesses. The America Invents Act is the most significant jobs creation bill passed by Congress this year. No longer will American inventors be forced to protect the technologies of today with the tools of the past. H.R. 1249 brings our patent system into the 21st century, reducing frivolous litigation while creating a faster and more efficient process for the approval of patents. The current patent system is broken. The average wait time for patent approval in the U.S. is three years. The PTO has a backlog of 1.2 million patents pending approval. Unwarranted lawsuits that typically cost five-million dollars to defend prevent legitimate inventors and industrious companies from creating products and generating jobs. And according to a recent media report, China is expected to surpass the United States for the first time this year as the worlds leading patent publisher. In other words, the system intended to protect and promote new inventions has become a barrier to innovation and job creation American inventors have led the world in new technologies for centuries, from Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison to the Wright brothers and Henry Ford. But if we want to foster future creativity, we must do more to encourage todays inventors. This bill represents a fair compromise and creates a better patent system for inventors and innovative industries. I look forward to working with the Senate to get a bill to the Presidents desk and finally seeing these important reforms enacted into law. Intellectual Property Subcommittee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) also praised the passage of H.R. 1249. Rep. Goodlatte: This legislation will ensure the PTO issues better quality patents, reins in litigation abuses and gives the PTO the resources it needs to eliminate the almost one million patent backlog. This will unleash further innovation in America and get Americans back to work. We will continue to work to see this pass the Senate and get signed into law. H.R. 1249 was approved by the House Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 32-3. Similar legislation passed the Senate with overwhelming support by a vote of 95-5. The bill enjoys broad support from industry leaders, academic institutions and independent inventors.

06.21.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today received the National Parks Heritage Award from the National Parks Conservation Association. He received this honor in recognition of his votes to preserve Americas heritage through the enhancement of our National Park System. Our national parks are a great source of pride for all Americans and it is critical that we preserve them for future generations to enjoy, said Smith. Texas is home to several of these great parks, including the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. I was proud to co-sponsor legislation last Congress to expand the boundary of that park by more than 150 acres. The San Antonio Missions National Historical Park and the other national parks around the country are irreplaceable natural resources that help us preserve our history. I am honored to receive this award and I will continue working to enhance our national parks. Congressman Lamar Smith has demonstrated a solid commitment to trying to protect and improve our National Park System so that it can better represent the history and culture of our diversifying nation, said Tom Kiernan, president of the National Parks Conservation Association. As we look to the national parks centennial in 2016, support from our members of Congress will be essential for future generations to enjoy our national park legacy.
06.15.2011	The House Judiciary Committee today approved a balanced budget amendment (H.J. Res. 1) to the Constitution to restore fiscal responsibility and accountability to federal government spending. The proposal for a balanced budget amendment passed the Committee by a vote of 20-12. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) delivered the following statement during the Committee debate. Chairman Smith: Since 1960, the annual federal budget has been balanced only six times and the federal deficit has climbed from $300 billion in 1960 to over $14 trillion today. America cannot continue to run huge federal budget deficits. Financing federal overspending through continued borrowing threatens to drown Americans in high taxes and heavy debt. Polls show that 95% of Americans believe the deficit is a problem and that 65% of Americans are in favor of a balanced budget amendment. If we want to make permanent cuts to federal spending”cuts that cannot be undone by future Congresses”a constitutional amendment is the only answer. It is our last line of defense against Congresss constant desire to overspend and overtax. Amending the Constitution is not easy, nor is it a task that should be taken lightly. Weve only amended the Constitution 27 times. But Americas continued economic prosperity depends on changing our course on federal spending and growing deficits. We must solve our debt crisis to save our future. A copy of H.J. Res. 1 and a full copy of Chairman Smiths remarks can be found at: https://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/mark_06152011.html
06.14.2011	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce today sent a letter to Members of the House of Representatives expressing support for the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249) saying, this legislation is crucial for American economic growth, jobs and the future of U.S. competitiveness. The Chamber praised the decision to shift the U.S. to a first-inventor-to-file system calling the provision both constitutional and wise. The Chamber also expressed support for the bills important legal reforms that would help reduce unnecessary litigation against American businesses and owners. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) welcomed todays letter from the Chamber of Commerce. Chairman Smith: Support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce underscores the need for patent reform to reinvigorate our economy and generate jobs for American workers. The current patent system has become a barrier to innovation. Americas inventors and job creators spend years and millions of dollars defending their claims to patent ownership. Meanwhile, our competitors are busy developing new products that expand their businesses and grow their economies. Supporters of H.R. 1249 understand that the more time we waste on frivolous litigation, the less time we have for innovation. H.R. 1249 encourages American innovators to develop new products that generate well-paying jobs and grow the economy. I look forward to working with the Chamber and all of our supporters, including industry leaders, independent inventors and academic institutions, to ensure enactment of this important legislation.

06.14.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 2164), a bill that could open up millions of jobs for unemployed Americans and legal immigrants. The legislation improves the E-Verify system and makes it mandatory for all U.S. employers. Chairman Smith: With unemployment at 9%, jobs are scarce. Despite record unemployment, seven million people work in the U.S. illegally. These jobs should go to legal workers. E-Verify is a successful program to help ensure that jobs are reserved for citizens and legal workers. The ˜E in E-Verify could just as well stand for ˜easy and ˜effective. It takes just a few minutes to use and easily confirms 99.5% percent of work-eligible employees. There is no other legislation that can be enacted that will create more jobs for American workers. Americans overwhelmingly support making E-Verify mandatory. According to a recent Rasmussen poll, 82% of likely voters think businesses should be required to use E-Verify. E-Verify was created in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. It allows employers to electronically verify that newly-hired employees are legally authorized to work in the United States. Specifically, the Social Security numbers of new hires are checked against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records in order to eliminate fraudulent numbers and help ensure that new hires are genuinely eligible to work. The program quickly confirms 99.5% of work-eligible employees. Today, over 250,000 American employers voluntarily use E-Verify and an average of 1,300 new businesses sign up each week. Outside evaluations have found that the vast majority of employers using E-Verify believe it to be an effective and reliable tool for checking the legal status of their employees. E-Verify has received overwhelming bipartisan support since its creation as a pilot program in 1996. It was extended in 2002, 2008 and 2010. In 2008, the House passed a stand-alone five-year extension of E-verify by a vote of 407-2. And in 2009, the Senate passed a permanent E-Verify extension by voice vote. Original cosponsors include Reps. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), John Carter (R-Texas), Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), Gary Miller (R-Calif.), Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.), and Immigration Subcommittee Chairman Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.). The Immigration Subcommittee will hold a legislative hearing on H.R. 2164 on Wednesday, June 15, at 10:00 am. Below is a summary of some of the major components in H.R. 2164. · Repeals I-9 System: Repeals the current paper-based I-9 system and replaces it with a completely electronic work eligibility check. · Gradual Phase-In: Phases-in mandatory E-Verify participation for new hires in six month increments beginning on the date of enactment. Within six months of enactment, businesses having more than 10,000 employees are required to use E-Verify. Within 12 months after enactment, businesses having 500 to 9,999 employees are required to use E-Verify. Within 18 months after enactment, businesses having 20 to 499 employees must use E-Verify. And within 24 months after enactment, businesses having 1 to 19 employees must use E-Verify. · Agriculture: Requires that employees performing agricultural labor or services are only subject to an E-Verify check within 36 months of the date of enactment. Under the bill, an individual engaged in seasonal agricultural employment is not considered a new hire if the individual starts work with an employer for whom they have previously worked. · Federal Preemption: Preempts state laws mandating E-Verify use for employment eligibility purposes but retains the ability of states and localities to condition business licenses on the requirement that the employer use E-Verify in good faith under the federal law. · Safe Harbor: Grants employers safe harbor from prosecution if they use the E-Verify program in good faith, and through no fault of theirs, receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation.

06.01.2011	Former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey today sent a letter to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office supporting the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249), which modernizes and reforms the patent system. H.R. 1249 implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to weed out bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. Earlier this year, the House Judiciary Committee approved H.R. 1249 with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 32-3. Similar legislation overwhelmingly passed the Senate by a vote of 95-5. In his letter, former Attorney General Mukasey outlined the constitutional basis for the first-inventor-to-file provision, saying that the House legislation is both constitutional and wise. Mukasey asserted that the proposal is constitutional because it leaves unchanged the existing requirement that a patent issue only to one who ˜invents or discovers. In a letter yesterday to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke expressed his support for H.R. 1249, saying we look forward to working with Congress toward prompt passage of legislation that will enable more timely and quality-focused examination of patent applications, establish a secure funding mechanism for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and reduce litigation uncertainties and costs. In addition to support from the administration, H.R. 1249 has broad support from industry leaders, academic institutions and independent inventors. Below is a list of groups who have written in support of H.R. 1249: Advanced Micro Devices American Bankers Association American Council on Education --- 1600 plus institutions and associates American Institute of Certified Public Accountants American Insurance Association American Intellectual Property Law Association (16,000 members) Association of American Medical Colleges --- 134 U.S. schools plus 400 teaching hospitals Association of American Universities --- 61 US Universities Association of Public and Land-grant Universities “ 221 Schools Biotechnology Industry Organization (more than 1,000 members) Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform (48 members, consisting of a diverse industry-range of corporations and trade associations) Coalition for Patent Fairness “ Technology Industry DuPont Eli Lilly The Financial Services Roundtable General Electric IBM Independent Community Bankers of America Independent Inventors (letter from 100 independent inventors) The United Inventors Association of America Microsoft Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Procter & Gamble Company Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association Small Business & Entrepreneurship (SBE) Council “ 100,000 members
05.31.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today released this statement after the House voted against a bill to raise the federal governments debt limit by $2.4 trillion. Tonights vote made it clear that Republicans are committed to cutting spending and reducing our nations debt, and we will not vote to increase the debt limit without substantial spending cuts and reforms. If President Obama and Congressional Democrats want to raise the debt limit, they must be willing to work with Republicans to cut spending and get our debts and deficits under control. House Republicans will not support an unconditional increase in the debt limit to continue spending money we dont have. It is imperative that we address our debt crisis now to secure the economic future of our nation.
05.27.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today released this statement in honor of Memorial Day on Monday, May 30th. On Memorial Day each year we honor those who laid down their lives to preserve our freedom. For over 100 years, America has set aside this day to remember those who died fighting to protect our country. The United States has fought 10 wars throughout its history, from the Revolutionary War to the most recent, the Global War on Terror. As we take time during this holiday to honor our fallen heroes, we should also remember the sacrifices our troops are currently making to ensure a safe future for our nation. Freedom exacts a high price, and Memorial Day is a time for all Americans to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. We will never forget their service or the debt of gratitude that is owed to them.
05.26.2011	Congress today reauthorized important national security provisions that are critical to our intelligence community’s ability to prevent terrorist attacks and keep America safe. The bill (S. 990) extends for four years three expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act, including the roving wiretaps, business records and lone wolf provisions. The provisions were scheduled to expire tonight at one minute past midnight. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) urged his colleagues to support the important provisions during the House floor debate. Chairman Smith: “Some argue that since we haven’t had a major terrorist attack since September 11th we no longer need these laws. Others argue that the death of Osama bin Laden brought an end to al Qaeda and the War on Terror. Both of these claims lack merit. The PATRIOT Act provisions continue to play a vital role in America’s counter-terrorism efforts, not only to prevent another large-scale attack, but also to combat an increasing number of smaller terrorist plots. “These are common sense provisions that have worked effectively for nearly 10 years to prevent terrorist attacks, protect the American people and preserve civil liberties. This bill is a bipartisan, bicameral compromise to reauthorize the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions for four years. By doing so, Congress is ensuring that critical intelligence will be collected and terrorist plots will be disrupted. “The terrorist threat we face as a nation has not expired. Neither should these important provisions that have helped keep us safe from terrorist attacks.” Summary of Reauthorized Provisions: Roving Wiretaps: Allows intelligence officials, after receiving approval from a federal court, to conduct surveillance on terrorist suspects regardless of how many communication devices they use. Roving wiretaps are nothing new. Domestic law enforcement agencies have had roving wiretaps for criminal investigations since 1986. If we can use roving wiretaps to track down a drug trafficker, why shouldn’t we also use it to prevent a terrorist attack? Business Records: Allows the FBI, after obtaining approval from a federal judge, to access tangible items, including business records, in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and espionage cases. Lone Wolf: National security laws allow intelligence gathering on foreign governments, terrorist groups and their agents. But what about a foreign terrorist who either acts alone or cannot be immediately tied to a terrorist organization? The lone wolf definition simply allows our intelligence officials to answer threats from terrorists acting alone. It cannot be used against a U.S. citizen.
05.26.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today received the Guardian of Seniors Rights Award from the non-partisan 60 Plus Association. 60 Plus presented the award to Smith for voting to protect Medicare and Social Security for current retirees and future seniors. With so many false attacks and misinformation about the Republicans budget, it is crucial that we get the facts out, said Smith. We know that if we do nothing Medicare will become insolvent in ten years according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. For the sake of our nations seniors, we cannot afford to wait to fix Medicares impending insolvency. We must also strengthen Social Security, which the GOP budget does by forcing action from the President and both chambers of Congress to advance solutions and ensure its solvency. I am honored to receive this award and I will continue working to save these vital programs so they are available for current seniors and future generations. 60 Plus Chairman Jim Martin said, "we seniors felt we should show our gratitude to dedicated lawmakers like Lamar Smith who show compassion towards the elderly by pledging to 1) always protect Medicare, 2) always protect Social Security, and 3) just as importantly, to vote against wasteful spending of our tax dollars, excessive spending that has our government now borrowing over 40 cents of every dollar it needs to pay its bills. Seniors have to balance their budgets and so should our government. Martin praised Congressman Smith for "his commitment to look out for America's greatest generation as well as the Congressman's promise to always work to preserve Medicare and Social Security for future retirees, our children and grandchildren."
05.12.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith held two telephone town meetings with his Bexar County constituents. Smith uses tele-town halls, to stay in touch with constituents when he is in Washington for votes. My constituents participation has been tremendous, said Smith. Through this forum I can reach out to people in the comfort of their own homes, hear from them on the issues of the day and address their questions and concerns. Its one of the best ways I can stay in touch with my constituents while Im in Washington and it helps me to do my job better. Over 9,000 residents of Bexar County participated in the two one-hour telephone meetings. He also asked four poll questions, the results of which were tabulated by the tele-town meeting technology: 1) What should be the primary source of our energy production? 35% said oil and natural gas 12% said alternative sources such as wind and solar 53% said a combination of all of the above 2) How do you think Washington should reduce the federal deficit? 61% said Congress should reduce government spending 6% said Congress should increase taxes 30% said a combination 3% said undecided 3) Do you support using taxpayer funds to pay for abortions? 12% said that we should allow taxpayer money to pay for abortions 79% said that we should not allow taxpayer money to pay for abortions 9% were undecided 4) How have high gas prices affected you and your family? 36% said they are cutting back on essential budget items, such as groceries 39% said they are cutting back on non-essential budget items, ie, going out to eat 25% said gas prices are not effecting their budget Smith said that he plans to conduct addtional tele-town hall in the coming weeks.
05.10.2011	Claiming that the border is more secure than ever, President Obama today called for legislation to legalize millions of illegal immigration during a speech he gave in El Paso, Texas. Following the Presidents remarks, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the statement below. Chairman Smith: It is ironic that President Obama would travel so close to the border and still be so far from reality. It is clear President Obama is in full campaign mode, but his words do not match his record. He continues to ignore the facts. The non-partisan Government Accountability Office has found that only 44% of the border is under the operational control of the Border Patrol, and only 15% is under actual control. Mr. President, 44% is a failing grade. And if 44% is the most secure the border has ever been, its time to get to work to improve the grade. The American people expect nothing less than an A+ on border security. Our immigration system is broken because the Obama administration has refused to fully enforce the immigration laws already on the books. Under this Administration, worksite enforcement activities are down by 70%. With 26 million Americans unemployed or underemployed and seven million individuals working illegally in the U.S., we need to put jobs for Americans first. The President is right that we are a nation of immigrants, but we are a nation of legal immigrants. And he is right that Washington needs to know that a movement is gathering, but this movement is comprised of the majority of Americans wanting to see our immigration laws enforced. Candidate Obama is back and along with him, a lot of misguided campaign promises. First it was Gitmo, then Obamacare and now the President is pushing for amnesty.
04.27.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that the State Firemen's and Fire Marshals' Association of Texas in Austin (SFFMA) has been awarded a grant of over $1 million to support the recruitment and retention of firefighters. This grant is critical for the State of Texas. Our firefighters have been working tirelessly to hold back the brush wildfires, and the SFFMAs work to support local departments has been central to these efforts, Smith said. Many of our local fire departments are staffed by volunteer firefighters, and this grant will directly assist local departments to recruit and train more firefighters during this time of serious need. The federal funding has been approved by the Department of Homeland Securitys Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. This award is part of the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER), an initiative designed to strengthen the nations ability to respond to fire and fire-related hazards.
04.15.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement after the House approved the fiscal year 2012 budget resolution, The Path to Prosperity: Restoring Americas Promise. The budget approved today honors House Republicans commitment to reducing government spending and creating jobs. This legislation tackles head-on all of the causes that contribute to our nations spending crisis. The ˜Path to Prosperity cuts $6.2 trillion in government spending over the next decade compared to the Presidents 2012 request. It will reform our tax code and keep taxes low so businesses can grow. It repeals the Democrats health care law and advances health care solutions focused on lowering costs. Under this plan, we will fulfill our promises to seniors and those near retirement, while strengthening programs for future retirees. This budget advances real solutions to the serious fiscal challenges confronting our nation. House Republicans continue to lead the way on cutting spending and creating an environment for economic growth, and I am proud to support this budget.
04.14.2011	The House Judiciary Committee today approved the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249), a bill to modernize and reform the patent system. The bill was reported favorably to the House floor by a vote of 32-3. Similar to legislation supported overwhelmingly by the Senate in March, H.R. 1249 implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to weed out bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the bills primary sponsor, today praised the Committee vote. Chairman Smith: Todays vote puts much-needed patent reform one step closer to enactment. The America Invents Act updates our patent system to make it easier for innovators to produce new technologies that drive economic growth and generate jobs. This important legislation is long overdue. The last major patent reform was nearly 60 years ago. Since then, American inventors have helped put a man on the moon, developed cell phones and launched the Internet. But we cannot protect the technologies of today with the tools of the past. Technological innovation from Americas intellectual property is linked to three-quarters of our economic growth. American IP industries account for over half of all U.S. exports and provide millions of Americans with well-paying jobs. In order to have a healthy economy, we must have a healthy patent system. These reforms discourage frivolous suits, enhance patent quality and streamline international principles. After six years of bipartisan efforts, I look forward to crossing the finish line on patent reform. H.R. 1249 has broad support from industry leaders and groups including: the Coalition for Patent Fairness, Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, Association of American Universities, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), GE, DuPont, BIO, Eli Lilly, IBM, Microsoft, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Financial Services Roundtable, American Bankers Association, American Insurance Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, American Institute of CPAs, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, American Council on Education, Association of American Medical Colleges and various independent inventors. A copy of the bill as amended by the Committee can be found at: https://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/mark_04142011.html Below is a summary of some of the main components in the House patent reform bill: First Inventor to File: Creates more certainty about patent ownership by adopting a first-inventor-to-file standard for awarding patents. Post-Grant Review: Establishes a new administrative construct called post-grant opposition that allows disputes involving patent quality and scope to be settled. Business Method Patents: Authorizes a special ex parte reexamination of business-method patents. This process allows business method patents to be re-examined using the best prior art as an alternative to expensive litigation and helps invalidate poor-quality patents. Third-Party Submission of Prior Art: Prevents bad patents from being awarded by permitting third parties to submit information regarding a patent application that may be relevant for the patent examiner to review. PTO Fee-Setting Authority & Revenue Retention: Authorizes the PTO Director to establish patent and trademark fees to recover the costs of services rendered to inventors and trademark filers. Allows the PTO to retain revenue generated by these fees in order to hire new examiners and address the patent backlog. Best Mode: Retains the best mode requirement for purposes of submitting an application, but prevents a defendant from claiming that a plaintiff failed to comply with the best mode requirement when filing for a patent.
04.13.2011	Congressman Smith issued this statement after the House passed a bill to defund $17.75 billion of slush funds in the health care reform law. Today House Republicans took another step toward defunding health care reform by permanently repealing a $17.75 billion slush fund in the law. Under the new health care system, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to spend billions of taxpayer dollars above and beyond the programs already appropriated in the law. These slush funds are not subject to further Congressional approval and effectively forfeit our power of the purse to unaccountable bureaucrats. Since passed, we have uncovered new spending, mandates, and taxes in the health care law, this fund being one example. I support repealing the law in its entirety and House Republicans will do whatever we can to ensure it is not fully implemented.
04.07.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement regarding House passage of a bill to fully fund the Department of Defense for the remainder of the fiscal year and provide a one-week continuing resolution of other government spending at reduced levels. We need to resolve our nations long-term budget and cut spending, but there is no excuse to hold military pay hostage in this budget debate. House Republicans just passed a continuing resolution that would fund military personnel for the rest of the fiscal year, and make real spending cuts while averting a government shutdown tomorrow. Our members of the military and their families sacrifice every day for our nation, and the least we can do in ensure that they are compensated for their service. I urge the Senate to pass this bill to guarantee that our military members are paid for the rest of the year.
04.05.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement regarding Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryans (R-WI) fiscal year 2012 House budget resolution, The Path to Prosperity: Restoring Americas Promise. The budget House Republicans introduced today focuses on the American peoples priorities “ cutting spending and creating jobs. We know that our country is currently facing a debt crisis. We currently borrow almost 40 cents of every dollar we spend. The Presidents recent budget proposal would make things worse. His budget plan doubles the debt held by the public at the end of his first term, and imposes $1.5 trillion in new taxes. The Path to Prosperity proposal addresses all aspects of out-of-control government spending. This budget cuts $6.2 trillion in government spending over the next decade compared to the Presidents budget. It keeps taxes low and reforms our tax code to help businesses invest and grow. It also repeals and defunds the Democrats health care law, and advances solutions focused on lowering costs. We must take steps now to secure the economic future of our nation. This budget is a common-sense plan to reform government and cut spending so that we can provide our children and grandchildren with a brighter future.
04.04.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to reports that the Obama Administration will prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) and the 9-11 co-conspirators in a military commission trial. Chairman Smith: Its unfortunate that it took the Obama administration more than two years to figure out what the majority of Americans already know: that 9-11 conspirator Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is not a common criminal, hes a war criminal. The terrorist attacks of September 11 were the worst in our nations history. Nearly 3000 innocent civilians were brutally murdered in an act of war against the U.S. As the mastermind of 9-11, KSM should stand trial as an enemy combatant before a military commission at Guantanamo Bay. Ten years is too long to wait for justice. I hope that this trial will give some solace to the families of the victims of 9-11. And I hope the Obama administration will stop playing politics with our national security and start treating foreign terrorists like enemy combatants. The Crime Subcommittee has a hearing on military commissions vs. civilian trials for foreign terrorists TOMORROW at 10:00 am ET in 2141 Rayburn House Office Building. The witness list includes David Beamer, father of United 93 passenger Todd Beamer.
03.31.2011	The United States Chamber of Commerce today honored Congressman Lamar Smith with its annual Spirit of Enterprise award for supporting legislation in Congress critical to the American business community. I will continue to support our job creators and promote a pro-growth economic agenda, said Smith. Our focus should be on creating a stable economic environment that encourages the private sector to invest and grow. The Chamber is honored to recognize Representative Smith for helping to create an environment in which businesses can grow and create jobs, said Thomas J. Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber. He has shown great conviction by standing on the side of business, at a time when it matters most. Today we honor him. Congressman Smith holds a lifetime 93% rating with the Chamber during his tenure in Congress. Senators and Representatives who back the Chamber on at least 70% of their key votes receive the Spirit of Enterprise award. Click here for photo of Congressman Smith receiving the Award.
03.30.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced a proposal to modernize and reform the patent system. Similar to legislation that passed the Senate earlier this month, the America Invents Act (H.R. 1249) implements a first-inventor-to-file standard for patent approval, creates a post-grant review system to weed out bad patents, and helps the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) address the backlog of patent applications. Chairman Smith: The strength of our economy relies on our ability to protect new inventions and build on innovation. Patents protect intellectual property and encourage the creativity that generates jobs and increases productivity. Unfortunately, our outdated patent system has become a barrier to innovation and invites lawsuits from holders of questionable patents seeking to extort millions of dollars from companies. We cannot protect the technologies of today with the tools of the past. We need reforms that discourage frivolous suits, enhance patent quality and streamline international principles. Better patents lead to products and innovations that generate jobs and drive economic growth. After six years of bipartisan efforts, I look forward to crossing the finish line on patent reform. A copy of the bill can be found at https://judiciary.house.gov/news/2011/march/033011_America%20Invents%20Act.pdf Below is a summary of some of the main components in the House patent reform bill: First Inventor to File: Creates more certainty about patent ownership by adopting a first-inventor-to-file standard for awarding patents. Post-Grant Review: Establishes a new administrative construct called post-grant opposition that allows disputes involving patent quality and scope to be settled. · Business Method Patents: Authorizes a special ex parte reexamination of business-method patents.

03.29.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today co-sponsored H.R. 49, legislation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create American jobs. This legislation would allow energy exploration in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) region, which would create up to 750,000 American jobs according to expert analyses. This legislation would help ease the burden of rising gas prices on families and small businesses by developing more of the energy resources we have in the U.S., said Smith. Increasing domestic drilling will help us meet our energy needs and create more jobs in the U.S. It is vital that we boost our energy independence and put more Americans back to work. Smith supports an all-of-the-above energy approach that uses domestically-produced oil, coal and natural gas, as well as alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal to create more American jobs and lower energy prices.
03.10.2011	Congressman Smith today co-sponsored the Lease Extension and Secure Energy (LEASE) Act of 2011, legislation to extend for one year the exploratory leases impacted by the Interior Departments moratorium. Smith: Offshore energy producers who operated responsibly in the Gulf have been unfairly forced to remain idle since the drilling moratorium went into place one year ago. During this time, producers still pay expenses on the lease, without being able to continue exploration. The LEASE Act returns the time lost during the moratorium and provides certainty to leaseholders so that they can continue exploration without the looming lease expiration. Gasoline prices have risen 20 cents in the last week alone, and we cannot afford to unfairly penalize our domestic energy producers. Senators Mary Landrieu and Kay Bailey Hutchinson have introduced companion legislation in the Senate.
03.10.2011	Four GOP Committee Chairmen today sent a letter to President Obama urging him to reduce costly government regulations that burden American businesses and restrict economic growth. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was joined in sending the letter by Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Small Business Chairman Sam Graves (R-Mo.). According to the Small Business Administrations Office of Advocacy, federal regulations cost our economy $1.75 trillion per year. These regulations are imposed by unelected federal officials who cannot be held accountable by American voters. The Obama Administrations December 2010 report on federal regulations listed 4,225 regulatory actions under development by federal agencies. Uncertainty about the cost of these upcoming regulations discourages employers from hiring new employees and expanding their businesses. The Chairmen urged President Obama to make a real commitment to regulatory reform by supporting legislation like the REINS Act, which requires congressional approval for government regulations with an economic impact of at least $100 million before they can be imposed on American businesses. Until Washington addresses head on the massive burden of existing regulation and uncertainty over future regulation, a stable groundwork for economic growth and job creation cannot be laid. We ask that you work with us to enact durable regulatory reform legislation that can cure this problem. A copy of the complete letter can be found at: https://judiciary.house.gov/news/2011/march/03102011RegulatoryReform.html
03.09.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced legislation to reduce frivolous lawsuits that plague our legal system. Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is expected to introduce a companion bill in the Senate. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (LARA) imposes mandatory sanctions for lawyers who file meritless suits in federal court. Federal rules mandating sanctions for frivolous suits were watered down in 1993, resulting in the current crisis of widespread lawsuit abuse. LARA restores the mandatory sanctions which hold attorneys accountable for lawsuit abuse. Chairman Smith: Lawsuit abuse has become too common in American society partly because the lawyers who bring these cases have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Plaintiffs lawyers can file frivolous suits, no matter how absurd the claims, without any penalty. Meanwhile defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys fees or a settlement. Our legal system encourages frivolous lawsuits while defendants are left paying the price even when they are innocent. Many of these cases have cost innocent people and business owners their reputations and hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act restores accountability to our legal system by reinstating mandatory sanctions for attorneys who file meritless suits. Though LARA will not stop all lawsuit abuse, it encourages attorneys to think twice before filing a frivolous lawsuit. Ranking Member Grassley: Without the serious threat of punishment for filing frivolous lawsuits, innocent individuals and companies will continue to face the harsh economic reality that simply paying off frivolous claimants through monetary settlements is often cheaper than litigating the case. This perverse dynamic not only results in legalized extortion, it leads to businesses spending money to defend against baseless lawsuits rather than to create new jobs. Every year, billions of dollars are wasted on frivolous lawsuits, costing jobs and damaging the economy. According to one analysis, the 2002 tort systems direct costs were $233 billion, the equivalent of a 5 percent tax on wages. Today that number is even higher; the annual direct cost of American tort litigation exceeds $250 billion. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act takes three strong steps to help thwart frivolous lawsuits. · Reinstates the requirement that if there is a violation of Rule 11, there are sanctions (Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was originally intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party). · Requires that judges impose monetary sanctions against lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits. Those monetary sanctions will include the attorneys fees and costs incurred by the victim of the frivolous lawsuit. · Reverses the 1993 amendments to Rule 11 that allow parties and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for making frivolous claims by withdrawing them within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been served.

03.09.2011	Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and 13 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee today sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder regarding recent allegations that ATF may have been complicit in the illegal transfer of firearms into Mexico. The members requested information regarding the Phoenix-based program known as Fast and Furious, which according to reports intentionally allowed straw buyers for criminal organizations to purchase thousands of guns so that ATF could track them across the border. Smith and the members criticized ATFs alleged actions saying, We find it ironic that the government allowed guns to be trafficked into Mexico as part of a program designed to stop guns from being trafficked into Mexico. We are also troubled that ATF engaged in activities that may have facilitated the transfer of guns to violent drug cartels while simultaneously attempting to restrict lawful firearms sales by border-area firearms dealers. According to the Center for Public Integrity, ATF allowed nearly 2,000 guns”valued at over one million dollars”to cross the border to known criminal organizations. Two of the guns from the program were found at the murder scene of Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry in December. The Department of Justice has requested that the Inspector General investigate the allegations. But more questions for the Department remain, including who authorized and directed the program. A copy of the complete letter can be found at: https://judiciary.house.gov/news/pdfs/HJC%20Gunrunner%20Letter.pdf
03.08.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith today joined Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins in introducing legislation to better protect citizens who report suspicious activity indicating possible terror activity. The See Something, Say Something Act expands protections against lawsuits for individuals who report terrorist-related activity and for law enforcement officers who respond to the tip. Just a few weeks ago in Texas, a tip from an alert citizen led to the arrest of a Saudi-national who was plotting to use a weapon of mass destruction against innocent civilians. According to the affidavit, Khalid Ali-M Aldawsaris list of targets included former U.S. military service members, dams, nuclear power plants and even the home of former President George W. Bush. The plot was uncovered when a chemical supplier notified the FBI about Aldawsaris attempt to purchase a toxic chemical called phenol. In 2010, a plot to bomb Times Square was thwarted when two individuals notified the NYPD after seeing smoke coming from a parked car. Chairman Smith: Time and again the brave actions of alert citizens have helped to thwart terror plots and save lives. It is not enough for intelligence officials and investigators to combat the terror threat alone. We need the help of alert citizens who see something suspicious and say something to authorities. This bill provides legal safeguards for vigilant citizens who provide tips regarding possible terror activity and the law enforcement officers who follow up on those leads. We cannot afford to let those who help prevent terror attacks become the targets of senseless liability suits. Senator Collins: An alert citizenry can be our first line of defense against terrorist attacks. We saw this during the Times Square attempted bombing and just recently in Lubbock, Texas. If not for the concerned citizens in these cases, the consequences may have been deadly. Our current legal system actually deters some citizens from coming forward and reporting these potential dangers. For example, in 2006, a group of US Airways passengers found themselves as defendants in a civil rights lawsuit after they reported six Islamic clerics requesting seat changes and asking for, but not using, seat belt extenders that could potentially be used as weapons. They were acting in good faith to report suspicious activity and ended up in tangled litigation. Our laws must do more to protect individuals like these, encouraging them to report suspicious activity when they see it and promote a sense of civic duty. Senator Lieberman: Time and again, weve seen terrorist plots disrupted because alert citizens noticed suspicious behavior and alerted law enforcement. Just last month, the FBI arrested a man in Texas who tried to buy dangerous chemicals from a supplier who notified authorities. We want to encourage such behavior and not let the threat of lawsuits deter honest citizens who see something, to say something. A copy of the bill can be found at: https://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/SeeSomethingSaySomething.pdf
03.08.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to the Senates overwhelming vote (95-5) to pass patent reform legislation. Chairman Smith: Todays vote in the Senate is a victory for American innovators who create businesses, generate jobs and drive economic growth. The current patent system is outdated and is bogged down by frivolous suits and uncertainty regarding patent ownership. Patent reform unleashes American inventors and allows patent holders to capitalize on their innovations and create new products and more jobs. The last major patent reform was nearly 60 years ago. Since then, American innovators have helped put a man on the moon, developed cell phones, created the Internet, and launched the iPad 2. From the light bulb to smart phones, intellectual property plays a critical role in our daily lives and global economy. But we cannot protect the technologies of today with the tools of the past. We need a patent system that keeps pace with ever-changing technologies and encourages new innovations. The Senate bill makes several important changes to our patent system. The House will introduce similar legislation this month that will help turn the ideas of American innovators into companies and jobs. Adopting a first-inventor-to-file standard creates certainty about patent ownership and makes it easier for American innovators to apply for patents around the world. The post-grant review process helps to reduce frivolous lawsuits filed by holders of weak or overbroad patents. And allowing for the third party submission of prior art helps prevent bad patents from being granted in the first place. These are just a few of the many provisions for which there is widespread support. Todays vote is an important development in our efforts toward meaningful patent reform. I look forward to achieving much-needed patent reform for American innovators and job creators.
03.03.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith will host his annual Academy Day event on Sunday, March 6. This event will provide high school students with information about the five US Service Academies and explain the process to obtain a nomination and appointment. Representatives from both Senate Offices and Congressional Districts 21, 20, 23, 28, 11, 27, 31 will be on hand, as well as officers from each of the service academies. I encourage all interested students to attend this event and learn more about the opportunity to attend one of our nations distinguished military service academies, said Smith. It is an honor for me to nominate the outstanding young people who are interested in pursuing their education at one of these academies. I am always inspired by the bright, capable, patriotic and dedicated men and women who are interested in attending the United States Air Force Academy, Naval Academy, Military Academy, or the Merchant Marine Academy. Serving in our armed forces is one of the greatest aspirations a young American can have and it is a great privilege of my job to nominate the exceptional young people who are eager to serve their nation. WHAT: Academy Day Event WHEN: SUNDAY, March 6th, at 2:00 pm WHERE: The University of Texas at San Antonio One UTSA Circle Mail Building, Ground Floor, 0.104 Use parking lots 3 or 4
03.03.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today co-sponsored a resolution directing the Secretary of the Interior to streamline the approval of drilling permit applications. This measure was introduced by Reps. Gene Green (TX-29) and Charles Boustany (LA-07). After last years oil spill in the Gulf, the Administration placed moratoriums on new shallow and deepwater drilling permits. But since the moratoriums were lifted, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) has issued only 37 new shallow water permits and one new permit for deepwater exploration. Smith: Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico is vital not only to the livelihood of its residents, but also our economy and national security. These delays on pending permits are unacceptable and will cost American jobs. The Administration should act now to streamline the drilling permit process and immediately restore shallow and deepwater drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. As events in the Middle East continue to unfold, it is vital that we increase our energy independence and put more Americans back to work. The resolution also states that Alaskas long term economic health depends upon the responsible development of oil and natural gas in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.
03.03.2011	Congressman Smith issued this statement after the House voted to repeal expanded 1099 tax reporting requirements. When I speak to small business owners across the 21st district, I often hear their frustration about how Washington mandates and regulations make it harder for them to succeed. But today, Congress delivered good news for small business owners across the country. With bipartisan support, the House repealed 1099 reporting requirements that burdened small businesses. This measure will help employers focus more on job creation and less on government red tape. The uncertainty created by new regulations and mandates holds back job creators and works against economic recovery. Repealing the expanded 1099 requirements is a victory for small businesses and American workers.
03.01.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today voted for a short-term continuing resolution that reduces government spending by $4 billion. The bill, which passed by a vote of 335 to 91 , will fund government operations for the next two weeks and allows more time for the Senate to consider H.R. 1, the continuing resolution passed by the House that cuts more than $100 billion in spending. The American people have made it clear they want us to cut spending and reduce the size of government, said Smith. The House already passed a bill to fund the government and cut more than $100 billion in spending, but Senate Democrats refuse to consider it. Republicans are working hard to keep the government running while honoring our pledge to cut spending and encourage economic growth from the private sector. I hope that the Senate will quickly pass this measure for the good of our country.
02.24.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to the thwarted terror plot in Texas. Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, a 20-year-old citizen of Saudi Arabia in the U.S. on a student visa, is charged with the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and is alleged to have listed the home of former President George W. Bush as a possible target. Chairman Smith: The terror plot in Texas underscores that the lax enforcement of our immigration laws is a gaping hole in our security system. According to the affidavit, Aldawsari has been planning to commit a terror attack against the U.S. for years. That is precisely why he applied for a student visa, in order to gain entry to the U.S. and carry out his plot. We shouldnt be surprised that terrorists continue to enter the U.S. on visas when our immigration laws are so loosely enforced. The 9-11 hijackers entered the U.S. after obtaining visas. And the Christmas Day bomber was able to board a plane en route to Detroit because he too had a visa. History is only repeating itself because we are letting it. We must do more to screen visa applicants to prevent terrorists from entering the U.S. in the first place. According to the affidavit, Aldawsari wrote in his journal that to avoid detection, he would need multiple drivers licenses and a forged U.S. birth certificate. The 9-11 hijackers fraudulently obtained more than 30 drivers licenses and identification documents. These allowed them to ultimately board commercial planes on September 11. Thats why Congress passed the REAL ID Act, which established national guidelines for the issuance identification documents to prevent terrorists from obtaining drivers licenses. Unfortunately, the Obama Administration continues to delay the full implementation of this law. In addition to stronger enforcement of immigration laws, we need the PATRIOT Act to prevent attacks from both terrorist organizations and rogue terrorists acting alone. Provisions of the PATRIOT Act are scheduled to expire in May. We cannot afford to leave our intelligence community without the resources they need to keep Americans safe. This was a victory for our law enforcement community, but a failure of our immigration system. We have not learned the lessons of 9-11. Until we crack down on our immigration laws that allow terrorists to enter the U.S., history will continue to repeat itself.
02.23.2011	(SAN ANTONIO) ”Congressman Lamar Smith released this statement today after holding a Job Creators Roundtable with small business owners. Today I met with small business owners from the 21st district to discuss how government impacts their ability to create jobs. Small businesses are the engine of job creation in this country, creating 65 percent of jobs in this country. Yet, rather than bend to small business needs, Washington too often rigidly demands that small business bend to Washington. Instead, we need to focus on creating a stable economic environment that encourages the private sector to invest and grow. I will continue to support our job creators, the small business community, and promote a pro-growth economic agenda.
02.23.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized the Administrations decision not to defend a federal marriage law enacted by Congress in 1996. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) affirms the definition of marriage as the union between one man and one woman. It was passed with bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton. Chairman Smith: The Justice Department has a responsibility to defend the laws passed by Congress regardless of the personal political views of the President or the Attorney General. The Obama Administrations decision not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act is irresponsible. There is no rule that requires the Justice Department to apply a higher standard of proof in these cases. And yet, DOJ has decided to apply that standard as an excuse to avoid defending the law. In other words, the Administration built a wall so that it could complain that its too tall to climb. It is a transparent attempt to shirk the Departments duty to defend the laws passed by Congress. This is the real politicization of the Justice Department “ when the personal views of the President override the governments duty to defend the law of the land. The vast majority of the American people believe that the preservation of marriage between a man and a woman is critical to societys stability and in the best interest of American families. It is not the role of the courts to redefine that institution and impose it on American society. The people alone”through their elected representatives”have that role and responsibility. And the President and his Administration are duty bound to defend those laws in court. Its disappointing that the Obama Administration continues to place politics above the will of the American people. To date, more than half the States in the U.S. have codified in their Constitutions the legal definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman.
02.17.2011	Today marks the 2nd anniversary of the so-called stimulus. After a record 21 months of unemployment at nine percent or higher, the law clearly failed to live up to the Obama Administrations promises. With a final price tag of over $1 trillion, the stimulus has done nothing but add to our out of control national debt, which currently stands at over $14 trillion. Government does not always know best”and the failure of the stimulus is an expensive reminder of this. The solution for reviving our economy is straightforward: cut job-destroying government spending to allow employers to create jobs.
02.16.2011	The President released his FY2012 Budget request on Monday. In this request, the President fails to confront the fiscal and economic challenges before us and continues on an unsustainable path. His budget spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much. It includes $8.7 trillion in new spending, $1.6 trillion in new taxes, and adds $13 trillion to our national debt. This week, House Republicans are focused on fulfilling our Pledge to America to cut federal spending by $100 billion. The House currently is considering H.R. 1, a bill to fund the remaining 7 months of FY 2011. Under this bill, we will achieve $100 billion in savings to the American taxpayer compared to the Presidents FY2011 request. This legislation is the largest single discretionary spending cut in the history of Congress. The solution for reviving our economy is straightforward: cut job-destroying government spending to allow employers to create jobs. H.R. 1 makes hard choices to help get the country back on track to fiscal health and economic prosperity. For more information on the Federal Budget, click here.
02.11.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith, founder of the Media Fairness Caucus in Congress, spoke last night about media fairness at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Smith gave remarks at CPACs Presidential Banquet. Excerpts from his remarks as prepared are below. Smith on Americans view of the media: Just 1 in 10 Americans trust the media, according to a Zogby poll. Gallup found that by a margin of three-to-one, Americans say the media are too liberal rather than too conservative. Studies show there is good reason for Americans lack of faith in the media. A UCLA study rated 18 of 20 major news outlets as more liberal than the typical American voter. Journalists who gave to President Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign outnumbered those who contributed to Sen. McCain by a margin of 20-to-1. And the nonpartisan Project for Excellence in Journalism found that media coverage of Sen. McCain was three times more negative than coverage of Sen. Obama during the campaign. Smith on the Media Fairness Caucus: Two years ago, I started the Media Fairness Caucus in Congress. This caucus can help encourage a free and fair press, as our founders intended. The purpose of the Media Fairness Caucus is not to censor or condemn, but to urge the media to adhere to the highest standards of their profession and to provide the American people with the facts, balanced stories and fair coverage of the news. Through the Media Fairness Caucus, Members of Congress point out media bias and encourage others to do the same. We use floor statements, op-eds, social networking, and other means of communication to highlight media bias at the national level and encourage the American people to become engaged and educated consumers of the media. Smith on Holding National Media Accountable: Ive always believed that all true reform starts with the voice of the people. If enough citizens criticize biased news stories or change the channel or cancel a subscription, then maybe the national media will give Americans what they want “ fair news coverage. Our national media should be held accountable for their performance, just like any other institution. We need to remind the media of their profound obligation to provide the American people with the facts, rather than tell them what to think.
02.01.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith today hosted constituent office hours in his San Antonio office from 9:00 am to 11:00 am. Smith met with over 100 constituents in this new format, which allows him to hear their concerns, and provide assistance with federal issues. These public office hours provide an opportunity for me to visit with my constituents. The response to my first public office hours has been encouraging, and hearing from my constituents is essential for me to fulfill my congressional duties. The attack that took place in Arizona should not deter me from carrying out my responsibilities to serve the people I represent. I want to continue to have an open exchange of ideas with my constituents. This will ensure that our democratic ideals remain secure.
01.31.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to another federal court ruling finding that the health care mandate”a key provision of Democrats health care law--is unconstitutional. District Court Judge Roger Vinson found that the individual mandate is an overreach of Congress constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause. As a result, Judge Vinson struck down the entire health care law. The foundation of the Democrats health care law is crumbling. Another federal district court has found that the individual mandate, which requires Americans to purchase health insurance, is an unconstitutional overreach of congressional authority. The individual mandate is undemocratic, unprecedented and unconstitutional. Never before has the federal government required people to buy any good or service, until now. The mandate is undemocratic because it limits peoples freedom to make their own decisions about health care. If we allow this abuse of authority to stand, where will it end? If Congress can require the American people to purchase health insurance, why not a car or any other product or service that Congress deems necessary? Congress should pass constitutional reforms that reduce health care costs while maintaining quality care. And we should oppose any law that violates the Constitution and common sense. Chairman Smith has previously announced that he plans to hold a hearing in February to further examine constitutional problems with the health care law and the individual mandate.
01.25.2011	Congressman Lamar Smith issued this statement today after President Obamas State of the Union speech. I hope that President Obamas address tonight represents a real commitment to change the direction of his Administrations policies, not simply a change in his rhetoric. The President campaigned as a moderate, spent the last two years pursuing policies far left of most of the country, and is now trying to once again come back to the center. The President promised America that unemployment would stay below 8 percent. Instead, we have had 20 consecutive months of unemployment over 9 percent and a massive spending spree disguised as a stimulus. He promised he would reduce our deficit and tighten the governments budget; instead, our deficit and our national debt have set new records. And we have seen the passage of a health care bill that will not decrease costs as promised, but increase national health care spending by more than $311 billion. For the 15 million Americans out of work today, words matter less than results. President Obama must follow through on implementing the tough solutions that are required to deal with our serious challenges. We need a new path forward that cuts spending and sets the foundation for economic prosperity and job creation.
01.25.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to the sentencing of Ahmed Ghailani for his role in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 224 people and wounded thousands. Chairman Smith: I am relieved that Ghailani received life in prison despite all the things that went wrong with his trial. The first foreign terrorist detained at Guantanamo Bay to be tried in civilian courts, Ghailanis trial was a test run for the Obama administrations plan to try foreign terrorists in U.S. courts. It was also a near disaster. Ghailani was acquitted of all but one of the 285 counts against him. Despite participating in the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa, Ghailani was only found guilty of one conspiracy charge. He was not held accountable for the 224 murders to which he had confessed. While the Administration will no doubt try to spin the verdict as a success, the truth is this case was a close call. If Ghailani had been acquitted of just one more count, he would have been considered innocent of these heinous crimes. The trial proved what Republicans have been saying all along: that civilian trials grant foreign terrorists the same rights as U.S. citizens. This makes it harder for prosecutors to obtain a conviction. The Obama Administration gambled with Americas security and our ability to ensure justice for hundreds of murdered civilians by bringing Ghailani to trial in civilian court. They just barely won a guilty verdict. And they are fortunate that a federal judge sentenced Ghailani to life in prison. This is why foreign terrorists should not be tried in civilian courts like common criminals. They should be tried as enemy combatants in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay.
01.24.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), senior Health Subcommittee Member Phil Gingrey, M.D. (R-Ga.), and Congressman David Scott (D-Ga.) today introduced The HEALTH Act (H.R. 5), a bill that includes meaningful medical liability reforms to lower the cost of health care while strengthening the doctor-patient relationship. In introducing the bill, the members urged President Obama to consider medical malpractice reforms that have proved effective in reducing health care costs while maintaining a high quality of care. President Obama has previously said that he wants to work to scale back the excessive defensive medicine ¦ and shift to a system where we are providing better care, simply “ rather than simply more treatment. Chairman Smith: The medical profession is plagued by frivolous lawsuits that are nothing more than the legalized extortion of doctors and hospitals. According to the Harvard School of Public Health, 40% of malpractice suits filed in the U.S. are ˜without merit. These suits drive up the cost of health care for all Americans and drive many experienced medical professionals out of business. Medical malpractice reform is the best way to reduce the costly practice of defensive medicine. The HEALTH Act incorporates lawsuit abuse reforms that have proved effective in states at reducing costs and enhancing the quality of care by limiting frivolous lawsuits. I urge President Obama to consider the effectiveness of malpractice reform and show bipartisan leadership by expressing support for time-tested tort reform proposals in his State of the Union address tomorrow. The American people deserve to benefit from the reduced costs and quality care that are the result of meaningful malpractice reforms. Congressman Gingrey: The HEALTH Acts proven reforms will make medical malpractice insurance affordable again, encourage health care practitioners to maintain their practices, reduce health care costs for patients, and save billions of dollars a year in federal taxpayer dollars by reducing the need for ˜defensive medicine. It is an effective way to stop wasteful spending within our health care system, while ensuring better outcomes for patients. As Co-Chair of the GOP Doctors Caucus and with over 30 years of experience as a physician, I know that the HEALTH Act is a time-tested and bipartisan approach to meaningful health care reform. If the President and Congress are truly interested in lowering the cost of health care in this country, the HEALTH Act is a very good place to start. Congressman Scott: Americans face many health care challenges including high annual insurance premium increases and too few doctors. Our legislation focuses on expenses that doctors face in higher medical malpractice insurance premiums and the expensive defensive medicine they practice as a hedge against liability. We also provide more certainty to young medical students who have been concerned about liability threats. While reducing frivolous liability claims will not solve all the health care challenges in the US, it can go a long way to helping doctors focus on what matters most: providing care.
01.20.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined Congressman Geoff Davis (R-Ky.) in introducing legislation to restore accountability to government regulations. The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act (H.R. 10) requires Congress to take an up-or-down vote on government regulations before they can be enforced on the American people and businesses. Specifically, the bill authorizes Congress to vote on regulations that will have an economic impact of at least $100 million or major increases in costs or prices for consumers. The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a subcommittee hearing on the REINS Act for January 24, 2011. The REINS Act was originally introduced by Congressman Davis in the 111th Congress. Chairman Smith: The REINS Act brings real change to Washington. For too long, unelected federal officials have imposed huge costs on the economy and American people through burdensome regulations. Because the officials authorizing the regulations are not elected, they cannot be held accountable by American voters. The REINS Act reins in the costly overreach of federal agencies that stifles job creation and hinders economic growth. It restores the authority to impose regulations to those who are accountable to the voters, their elected representatives in Congress. Rep. Davis: The American people have asked for more transparency and accountability from their government and the REINS Act is an important part of our response. The REINS Act would end the practice of Congress avoiding accountability through vaguely drafted legislation by requiring a vote on the most burdensome regulations generated by those laws. Members of Congress should never have an option to avoid responsibility for the effects of the laws they pass. Speaker of the House John Boehner praised the REINS Act as one of the first steps House Republicans are taking to fulfill our obligations to the American people consistent with our Pledge to America. The REINS Act gives a meaningful voice to job creators and families faced with a confusing and ever-growing regulatory code by ensuring that their elected representatives are directly accountable for the most significant regulations imposed by the federal government. For more information about the REINS Act, visit: https://GeoffDavis.house.gov/REINS
01.19.2011	(WASHINGTON) - Congressman Lamar Smith issued this statement today after voting to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. I voted to repeal the health care law because this bill is fundamentally flawed. Instead of pursuing common sense reforms, the Democrats law increased health care costs and imposed new mandates and penalties. The Presidents own Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that our nation's health costs would increase by $311 billion”about $1,000 per person. The cost of this law adds $701 billion to the deficit over the next ten years. In November, voters made it clear that Congress number one priority should be fixing the economy. The Democrats health care law sidelines job creation and prolongs economic uncertainty. We now have the opportunity to start over and get it right. I believe we can expand access to care while curbing costs, eliminating unfair mandates and penalties.
01.18.2011	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) today introduced a bill to close a dangerous loophole in Americas federal drug laws. The loophole allows drug trafficking organizations in the U.S. to plot their international drug shipments without fear of domestic prosecution. The Drug Trafficking Safe Harbor Elimination Act amends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit plotting to traffic drugs internationally when the plot takes place in the U.S., even when the drugs never come to this country. Because it is not a federal crime in the U.S. to traffic drugs from one international country to another, a recent court decision found that a conspiracy to traffic drugs internationally is also not covered under federal law, even if the conspiracy takes place inside the U.S. This bill enables law enforcement officials to disrupt international drug shipments and apprehend dangerous drug traffickers. It provides a way to dry up drug profits that fund the violence of terrorist organizations around the world, including the Taliban in Afghanistan and the FARC in Colombia. Chairman Smith: Criminals who plot from within our borders to traffic drugs internationally should not be given a free pass just because the drugs they transport never enter the U.S. In order to protect Americans and combat the illegal drug trade, we must ensure that conspirators in the U.S. are brought to justice. We know that the illegal profits from these organizations fuel violence and fund terrorism around the world. And it is increasingly important to combat international drug cartels as the drug war in Mexico brings violence closer to home. This bill will close the dangerous loophole that allows international drug traffickers to avoid prosecution in the U.S. Rep. Schiff: In light of the destructive trade in drugs and guns between the U.S. and Mexico, it is more important than ever to eliminate any safe harbor for drug traffickers. This bipartisan bill closes a loophole in current law, giving law enforcement officials the ability to prosecute drug trafficking conspiracies conducted in the U.S., even if many of the illegal acts occur outside our borders.
01.09.2011	(WASHINGTON) - Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement today regarding the shooting in Tucson, Arizona. I want my constituents to know that the reprehensible attack that took place in Arizona on Saturday will not deter us, as Members of Congress, from carrying out our duties to serve the people we represent and uphold the freedoms granted to us by our Constitution. The House stands together in condemnation of this senseless attack. I am returning to Washington to take part in the House resolution honoring Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and those who were killed, including Federal Judge John Roll. Gabrielle and all the victims remain in my thoughts and prayers."
01.05.2011	(WASHINGTON) - Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement today after voting for the new House rules package: These new rules make good on House Republicans promise to change the way we do business in Congress and establish a higher standard of openness and accountability. Now, all bills must be posted online for at least three days before a House vote, giving Americans the opportunity to read the legislation and contact their representatives in Congress. Along with increased transparency, these reforms will help us create jobs by limiting the federal government and cutting spending. The package passed today puts new mechanisms in place to foster fiscal responsibility and reform the budget process. The new ˜cut-as-you-go rule states that if mandatory spending increases, then spending must be cut by at least that much someplace else. By placing limitations on long-term spending now, this rules package is an important first step to rein in the federal budget.
12.17.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement today after voting to extend tax relief. The bill passed the House by a vote of 277-148. "Last night, I voted to extend tax relief for two reasons. First, lowering taxes will encourage individuals to save and invest, which will generate jobs and strengthen the economy. In the past, lowering taxes has spurred economic growth so that the additional tax revenue gained actually decreases the deficit. "Second, Americans pay enough in taxes and if this bill had not passed, every American who pays taxes would have paid more starting January 1, 2011. Without this bill, income taxes, capital gains taxes, and the inheritance tax all would have increased. The child tax credit would have been cut in half, and the estate tax would have jumped to 55 percent if Congress had failed to act. Additionally, this bill reduces payroll taxes, putting more money directly into workers pockets. "This bill passed the House with my support on December 16, 2010, by a vote of 277-148. (139 Democrats voted in favor,112 opposed; 138 Republicans voted in favor, 36 opposed). "We would not have had even this much success in holding the line on tax increases if we had waited until next year. Both the President and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate favor tax increases. "While I wanted to vote to make this tax relief permanent, extending these provisions for two years is better than the alternative, a higher tax bill for every American."
12.14.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith met today with Stef Paramoure, an education specialist from the 21st district and a 2009 recipient of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST). I was pleased to meet with Ms. Paramoure, an educator whose dedication and passion for teaching have been invaluable to the 21st district and earned her national recognition, said Smith. Quality science and math education is essential to Americas national security, economic strength, and the health care profession. I am grateful to Ms. Paramoure and the many teachers like her who are providing our nations future leaders and innovators with an excellent education. I believe passionately in my favorite classroom mantra, ˜Knowledge is power - get some, give some, said Paramoure. Quality professional development through the Texas Regional Collaboratives (TRC) in math and science teaching has played a crucial role in my ability to inspire the next generation of STEM students. TRC is a quality program that Texas can be proud of. Since 1983, the PAEMST has recognized outstanding K-12 teachers for excellence in teaching and contributions to mathematics and science education. The program is administered by the National Science Foundation, and 103 educators from across the nation were honored this year.
12.08.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) today was appointed by congressional Republicans to Chair the House Judiciary Committee for the next Congress. The appointment makes Smith the first Republican Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from Texas. Congressman Smith has served as the Committees lead Republican Member for the past four years. House Judiciary Committee Chairman-Elect Smith issued a statement following the announcement: Chairman-Elect Smith: The House Judiciary Committee is often referred to as the guardian of the Constitution. We must protect the principles of liberty, equality and justice for all Americans. As Chairman of the Committee, I will focus on efforts to strengthen national security, protect intellectual property, prevent frivolous lawsuits and keep children safe from Internet sex predators. The Judiciary Committee will support industries that employ millions of Americans by protecting their patents and copyrights. And we will promote worksite enforcement efforts that make sure scarce jobs go to legal workers. The Judiciary Committee also oversees two federal agencies that help prevent terrorist attacks. The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security should have the resources necessary to keep America safe. As Chairman, I am committed to strenuous oversight of the Obama Administration. We need to make sure that our laws are equally enforced, criminals are prosecuted and enemy combatants are kept off of American soil. House Speaker-Designate John Boehner supported Smiths appointment. Speaker-Elect Boehner: Throughout his tenure on the House Judiciary Committee, Lamar has been a strong leader on important issues facing the American people. He is dedicated to promoting economic growth to help put Americans back to work, strengthening our national security and keeping Americas communities and neighborhoods safe from crime. I look forward to working with him in the 112th Congress. Established in 1813, the House Judiciary Committee is the second oldest standing committee in Congress. Its jurisdiction often places it at the center of American politics, such as when it approved the USA PATRIOT Act following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The Committee also has considered impeachment charges against presidents of the United States in both 1974 and 1998. Particularly important today is the Committee's oversight responsibility for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. In the last Congress over one thousand bills and resolutions were referred to the Committee on such subjects as terrorism, crime, immigration, bankruptcy, civil liberties, constitutional amendments, patents and copyrights.
12.07.2010	A resolution introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith honoring Rotary International for 105 years of service unanimously passed the House of Representatives today. Smiths resolution has 72 co-sponsors. All across the United States, business, professional, and community leaders better their communities and the world, said Smith. For over a century now, Rotary Club members have worked to help those in need, and their efforts to provide humanitarian services, and promote international good will and peace are invaluable. Rotarys four point test that encourages truth, fairness, friendship and benefit to others in all actions is an inspiring model to live by. I want to commend all members for their dedication to the worthy mission and principles of Rotary. The mission of Rotary International is to provide service to others, promote integrity, and advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace through its fellowship. Rotary International has more than 1.2 million members in 34,000 clubs around the world. To watch Congressman Smith speak about his resolution on the House floor, click here.
11.19.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith was unanimously elected by his colleagues in the Texas Republican Delegation to be the regions representative on the House Republican Steering Committee. The Steering Committee, which will be headed by Speaker-Elect John Boehner, is made up of 13 regions. As a member of the Steering Committee, Smith will play a key role in selecting Committee Chairs and assigning Republican members to House Committees. I am honored to represent Texas on the Steering Committee, said Smith. I look forward to serving on this Committee. In the next Congress, all of our Committees will play a vital role in moving forward with our agenda to rein in government spending and create more jobs.
11.16.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that Comal County has been awarded a federal grant of over $10 million to help to reduce flood levels of Dry Comal Creek in southern Comal County, Texas. This is great news for Comal County residents, and this funding will enable us to better protect homes, businesses and lives from flooding, said Smith. Past hurricanes have shown us how important it is to have flood prevention measures in place. I will continue pushing for funding for critical projects like this to keep Comal County residents safe and help prevent devastating flood damage in the future. I want to express our sincere gratitude to Congressman Smith for his work on behalf of Comal County in obtaining this crucial flooding prevention funding, said Comal County Commissioner Jan Kennady. We are so appreciative of his efforts. This funding will enable us to reduce the impact of flooding in Comal County and save lives. The flood reducing structure will be constructed on a tributary of Dry Comal Creek in southern Comal County, Texas, to reduce flooding levels on downstream waters, particularly Dry Comal Creek and the Guadalupe River. The federal funding has been approved by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA will obligate funding for this project directly to the state. It is the state's responsibility to ensure that the grantee receives this award.
11.11.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement regarding Veterans Day. Today is an important day for us to honor all the veterans who served to protect our nation's freedoms and to pay tribute to those who never came home. Ours is a great nation and those who sacrificed for our country in the military have made it so. We continue to honor all our veterans, young and old, who have done so much for all Americans.
10.19.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today toured the new Facebook facility in Austin and met with employees. I was pleased to tour the new Facebook facility in Austin today, said Smith. Facebooks decision to expand here shows that Texas economic environment is drawing private sector jobs to our state. The federal government could learn a lot from our states pro-growth and low taxes approach. This facility will be a boost to the local economy, and the national high-tech industry. Facebook feels right at home in the heart of downtown Austin and were thrilled to welcome our congressman, Rep. Lamar Smith, to our new office, said Sarah Smith, Head of Online Operations for Facebook in Austin. Facebook is eager to help drive innovation and bring jobs to Texas and we look forward to working with Rep. Smith here and in Washington to ensure that Austins high-tech sector continues to thrive. Facebooks Austin office is the second online operations office in the U.S. and serves an important role in coordinating global support for Facebook users, advertisers, and developers. Facebook Austin opened in early May with just six employees and today the growing team totals more than 60 employees.
09.29.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today released the following statement after House Democrats voted to adjourn without addressing the vital issue of extending tax relief for the American people: Democrats in Congress wont tell the American people how much they will raise their taxes. Theyre going to wait until after the election when we come back into session. And Democrats in Congress wont tell the American people how they are going to spend their money. For the first time in 35 years no budget was offered. Meanwhile, the Democrats are spending almost two dollars for every one dollar the federal government collects. That puts a drag on the economy and kills jobs. The American people have had enough. Its time to end the one party monopoly in Washington.
09.29.2010	Last night, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5932, the Organized Retail Theft Investigation and Prosecution Act of 2010, by unanimous consent. The bill directs the Attorney General to establish an Organized Retail Theft Investigation and Prosecution Unit to combat the growing problem of organized retail theft. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) joined a group of bipartisan members in introducing the bill, including Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-Mich.), Committee Vice Ranking Member Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Congressman Bobby Scott (D-Va.). Ranking Member Smith: The vast marketplace on the Internet has made it increasingly difficult for law enforcement officials to identify and apprehend organized retail thieves. According to the FBI, organized retail theft costs businesses more than $30 billion in losses annually. By requiring the Attorney General to establish an investigative unit in the Justice Department dedicated to these cases, this bill cracks down on organized retail theft and protects American businesses. This legislation is the result of a bipartisan effort to combat organized retail theft, in which sophisticated, multi-level criminal organizations steal large amounts of high value products, focusing on small and easily marketable items, and then resell the goods through a variety of means. Organized retail theft harms retailers and, ultimately, consumers, who pay higher prices because of the losses to retailers and who sometimes undertake health risks by purchasing stolen items such as baby formula, which may not have been stored properly. H.R. 5932 is supported by the Coalition Against Retail Crime, the Food Marketing Institute, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the Entertainment Merchants Association, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the National Retail Federation, and eBay.
09.28.2010	Congressman Smith today released the following statement on the shooting at the University of Texas in Austin: My office has reached out to the University of Texas to offer support following this mornings shooting. It appears that UT police and first responders acted quickly in the best interest of the students and are in the process of securing the campus. By using text messages, loudspeakers and online postings, the campus was able to quickly notify students of the emergency and caution them to stay indoors. The most important thing for Texans to do right now is to pray for the safety of the students on campus.
09.23.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today received the Tax Fighter Award from The National Tax Limitation Committee (NTLC). Smith earned this award for his voting record on tax and spending issues in the 111th Congress. It is an honor to receive this award for supporting policies that let taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money and encourage private sector growth, Smith said. I remain committed to getting America back on track by curbing reckless federal spending, and putting an end to government takeovers and higher taxes. Congressman Smith has led the battle on behalf of taxpayers to stop the passage of ObamaCare and cap-and-trade legislation, to make the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, to eliminate the death tax, to kill the Alternative Minimum Tax, to provide incentives for private savings, investment and job creation and to control the growth of federal spending, said NTLC President Lewis K. Uhler. Congressman Smith has been a major asset to taxpayers across America during his congressional service, having earned the Tax Fighter Award consistently in every session of Congress, concluded Uhler.
09.23.2010	There are more illegal immigrants in the Texas workforce than unemployed Texans, the co-chairs of the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus noted today. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 1,004,400 citizens and legal immigrants currently looking for work in Texas. And according to a 2010 Pew Hispanic Center study, there are 1,050,000 illegal immigrants working or looking for work in Texas. Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas, a co-chair of the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus and Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement regarding the findings: Representative Smith: Texans should not have to compete with illegal immigrants for scarce jobs. Unfortunately, because the Obama administration refuses to enforce our immigration laws, out of work Texans are suffering. Worksite enforcement efforts have fallen dramatically since President Obama took office”administrative arrests are down 79% from 2008, criminal arrests are down 62%, and convictions are down 70%. That means it is easier for illegal immigrants to keep jobs that rightly belong to U.S. citizens and legal immigrant workers. According to the numbers released by the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus, Texas is the only state where the number of illegal immigrants in the workforce exceeds the number of unemployed citizens. But co-chair Smith said that doesnt mean other states are not affected by illegal immigration. Smith (R-Texas): According to the national numbers, out of work Texans are most affected by illegal immigrants in the workforce. But millions of Americans across the nation are still struggling to find work. If the Obama administration would simply enforce the law, we could make millions of jobs available for out of work Americans. Representative Myrick (R-NC): The unemployment rate in North Carolina could be cut almost in half if hard-working American citizens didnt have to compete for jobs with people here illegally. Breaking the law shouldnt be rewarded with a job. The Administration needs to get serious about enforcing our immigration laws. By doing so, we could put millions of American citizens back to work. Representative Miller (R-Calif.): Right now, nearly 2.3 million Californians are out of work, and this number does not account for the millions of others who have seen their hours reduced and wages cut during the recession. At the same time, however, nearly 1.8 million illegal immigrants hold jobs in California. This is simply unacceptable. If the Obama administration is serious about getting Americans off of the unemployment rolls, it needs to enforce our nations immigration laws to the highest extent, increase worksite enforcement efforts, and make E-Verify permanent. During these tough economic times, hardworking, job-seeking Americans deserve no less. The Reclaim American Jobs Caucus is a 40 Member, bipartisan caucus, headed by Representatives Lamar Smith, Sue Myrick and Gary Miller. As the national unemployment rate remains near 10%, the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus works to highlight the link between illegal immigration and record unemployment in the U.S. The Reclaim American Jobs Caucus compiled the numbers based off of an August 20 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a September 1 study by the Pew Hispanic Center.
09.23.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith was recognized today by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) as a Guardian of Small Business. Smith earned the award for his strong record of supporting small business in the 111th Congress. I am honored to receive this award from NFIB for supporting policies that help small businesses succeed, said Smith. In my recent meetings with small business owners in the 21st district, one thing I heard over and over again was that the threat of new taxes and regulations is keeping many small businesses sidelined. America cant afford to have our best job creators sidelined for much longer, and Congress must do everything it can to help the private sector recover and remove the burdensome regulations that harm small business. The NFIB stated that, "In the 111th Congress, Representative Smith proved that he is a champion of small business. The Guardian of Small Business Award is a token of the deep appreciation that small business owners have for elected officials who promote and protect their right to own, operate and grow their businesses."
09.23.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today released the following statement after House Republicans unveiled A Pledge to America, a new governing agenda focused on the American peoples priorities. The Pledge, which lays out specific policy solutions that Congress can enact today, is an agenda based on the concerns and ideas that House Republicans heard from constituents on federal spending, government reform, economic prosperity, health care, and other key issues. Across the 21st district of Texas, and across the nation, Americans have been speaking out against policies that are expanding the size of government, ballooning our national debt, and prolonging an environment of economic uncertainty. Washington cannot ignore the voices of the American people anymore. The Pledge includes a cap on federal spending to address one of the biggest problems facing America, exploding national debt. I introduced H.R. 5323, the SAFE (Saving America's Future Economy) Act, to stop runaway government spending and the rising deficits that threaten our economic security. The SAFE Act limits annual increases in federal spending to the sum of percentage increases in population growth and inflation and enables us to achieve a balanced budget in six years. The Pledge to America is a renewed commitment from House Republicans to restore Congress to its proper constitutional role: to serve the people and put a check on overreaching executive power.
09.14.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today co-sponsored legislation to repeal language in last months education funding bill that discriminates against only the state of Texas, and could prevent Texas from receiving its fair share of the federal education funding. The bill was introduced by Congressman Michael Burgess (R-Lewisville). The legislation would repeal the language that calls for Texas to make additional requirements beyond what all other states are required to make in order to qualify for the funding. These additional requirements are not only inequitable, but according to Texas officials, would require the state to make assurances that violate the Texas Constitution. Further, requiring only Texas to meet additional requirements under the section titled Additional Requirements For The State Of Texas that no other states are required to make puts Texas schoolchildren at an unfair advantage. On August 6, 2010, all 22 Republican members of the Texas Congressional delegation, including Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging her to strike the language. The lawmakers wrote, ¦this amendment singles out only the State of Texas¦and no other state in the nation is subject to these additional requirements¦the House language only punishes Texas students and teachers. Unfortunately the language was not stripped, and consequently, on September 9, 2010, Texas application for the $830 million in education funding was denied by the U.S. Department of Education. Texas Republicans joining Smith and Burgess in introducing the legislation are: Congressman Joe Barton Congressman Kevin Brady Congressman John Carter Congressman Michael Conaway Congressman John Culberson Congressman Louie Gohmert Congresswoman Kay Granger Congressman Ralph Hall Congressman Jeb Hensarling Congressman Michael McCaul Congressman Randy Neugebauer Congressman Pete Olson Congressman Ron Paul Congressman Ted Poe Congressman Pete Sessions Congressman Mac Thornberry Senators Hutchison and Cornyn introduced the Senate version to repeal the language, S. 3768, yesterday in the Senate.
09.03.2010	Media Fairness Caucus Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today issued the following statement in response to BBC Director Mark Thompsons admission that the British news organization has had a "massive" left-wing bias. Congressman Lamar Smith: Its refreshing to see a liberal news outlet acknowledge its bias. On behalf of the seven in 10 Americans who say that news sources are biased, I urge the national media here in the U.S. to follow the BBCs lead and admit their own liberal bias. With each passing day, the national medias liberal agenda becomes clearer. Journalists who gave to President Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign outnumbered those who contributed to Senator McCain by 20-to-1, according to Investors Business Daily. Reporters leaked e-mail messages from the Journolist controversy gave Americans a look behind the curtain of the national media “ and the view isnt pretty. And in recent days, when a radical environmentalist took hostages at the Discovery Channel, the national media largely avoided calling him a ˜left-wing extremist, even though they frequently use the label ˜right-wing extremist. Its no wonder just 8 percent of Americans trust the media, according to a Zogby poll, and that by a margin of more than 3 to 1, Americans say the average reporter is more liberal than they are, rather than more conservative, according to a Rasmussen survey. If the media wont give Americans all the facts, they should at least come clean and admit their liberal bias.
08.04.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today hosted a small business forum with constituents in San Antonio. The forum was structured as part of a nationwide initiative called America Speaking Out, which is designed to start an honest conversation between Americans and their representatives. There has been a growing disconnect between the priorities of the American public and the policies coming out of Washington, said Smith. When you consider the taxes, the spending, and the increased debt, its clear that Washington has been doing what is best for Washington, not American small businesses. This forum gave me the opportunity to hear directly from small business owners in the 21st district, who have valuable experience and a personal perspective on what policy makers in Washington can do to foster a healthy economic environment for small businesses.
07.28.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith said today that the Obama Administration and the Democratic Congress have set six regrettable records. He made his remarks on the House floor. Smith commented, Unfortunately, these records are not the ones the American people hoped for. One: Americans are staying unemployed longer than ever before. The average duration of unemployment has risen to over thirty-five weeks, nearly two times longer than the previous high for any downturn. Two: For the first time since the current budget rules were adopted thirty-five years ago, the House will not pass a budget. Three: The federal debt has never been larger. It has now reached over $13 trillion. Four: The cost of health care has never been higher. Five: We are more dependent on foreign oil than ever before. Sixty percent of our oil is imported. And Six: the federal government has taken control of an unprecedented number of private companies, according to the Congressional Research Service. Smith added, These records stifle economic growth and hurt all Americans. They are taking our country in the wrong direction.
07.28.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that he will be hosting two small business forums for constituents in San Antonio and Austin. These forums will be structured as part of a nationwide initiative called America Speaking Out, which is designed to start an honest conversation between Americans and their representatives. There has been a growing disconnect between the priorities of the American public and the policies coming out of Washington, said Smith. When you consider the taxes, the spending, and the increased debt, its clear that Washington has been doing what is best for Washington, not American small businesses. I want to hear from my constituents, who have valuable experience and a personal perspective on what policy makers in Washington can do to foster a healthy economic environment for small businesses.

07.21.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith announced that he has joined the new Tea Party Caucus, which held its first meeting today with 30 members attending. The congressional caucus was formed by Congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-MN). All true reform starts with the voice of the people, not politicians in Washington, Smith said. It is the American people who will turn our country in the right direction. I strongly support the Tea Partys principles of fighting reckless government spending, upholding our Constitution and protecting the traditional values upon which our nation was founded. Members of Congress dont speak for the Tea Party, we listen to the Tea Party, and together we can help return America to greatness.
06.23.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement regarding reports that 17 members of the Afghan military have gone AWOL over the course of two years from Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio: Congressman Smith: Both the Air Force and Department of Homeland Security must provide Congress with a full briefing on how 17 Afghan military members were able to go AWOL from Lackland Air Force base. Its no surprise that individuals who come to the U.S. legally on visas decide to stay illegally. But when those individuals are foreign military officers”with special access to military facilities”it creates a serious national security threat to American communities. This is precisely why immigration enforcement is so important. If the Department of Defense is going to bring foreign military officers into the U.S. for training, there needs to be a system to make sure that they do not go AWOL. If the Department of Homeland Security had implemented a biometric system to track the departure of visitors in the United States, we would at least know how many of these 17 individuals to look for inside the U.S. I am very concerned that this has been a problem for years and yet the Department of Homeland Security is just now issuing an alert. My staff has contacted the Air Force and Department of Homeland Security to information regarding what went wrong. To keep the American people safe, we must ensure that individuals brought to the U.S. for military training are not allowed to disappear into American communities. Congressman Smith is a member of the Homeland Security Committee and serves as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee.
06.23.2010	The Congressional Reclaim American Jobs Caucus reacted today to a video message from Labor Secretary Hilda Solis in which she says, Every worker in America has a right to be paid fairly, whether documented or not... The video message includes the phone number for a taxpayer-funded and government operated confidential hotline at the Labor Department. Representatives Lamar Smith (TX-21), Sue Myrick (NC-09) and Gary Miller (CA-42), the co-chairs of the Congressional Reclaim American Jobs Caucus, issued the following statement in response to the video: The Obama administration has failed to create jobs. Theyve spent more than a trillion dollars on so-called ˜jobs and stimulus legislation, but unemployment is still at 9.7 percent. Now, the Obama administration is campaigning for illegal immigrants! And, when illegal immigrants call the government hotline, the Obama administration will give them safe harbor while they use American tax dollars to pursue their claims. The Supreme Court, in the case of Hoffman Plastic Compounds vs. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), determined that the NLRB could not force the company to pay backpay to an illegal immigrant since that remedy conflicted with other federal law. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) prohibits the knowing employment of illegal immigrants and requires new employees to provide documents to employers proving their identity and legal authority to work. The Court ruled that: ˜¦awarding backpay to illegal aliens runs counter to policies underlying IRCA, policies the Board has no authority to enforce or administer. . . . [A]warding backpay in a case like this not only trivializes the immigration laws, it also condones and encourages future violations. The Obama administration has it backwards. They have all but abandoned worksite enforcement efforts. Through April, administrative arrests are down 80 percent, criminal arrests are down 68 percent, the number of criminal indictments is down 74 percent and convictions are down 75 percent since 2008. What an insult to the millions of unemployed citizen and legal immigrant workers who need those jobs held by millions of illegal immigrants!
06.17.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith this week held two telephone town meetings with his Bexar County constituents. He uses the new technology; also known as a tele-town hall; to stay in touch with constituents throughout his district. Tele-town meetings enable me to get comments; questions and advice from residents in the 21st district; said Smith. We dont screen calls as this is an excellent way for me to hear what constituents feel strongly about. The calls went out to Smiths constituents in Bexar County on Monday and Wednesday evening asking them to participate in a live telephone town meeting. Smith also asked four poll questions; with the following results: 1) Do you believe the Administration has properly handled the oil spill in the Gulf%3f 14% said yes. 76% said no 10% were undecided. 2) Do you believe the federal government is doing enough to enforce immigration laws and to secure our border%3f 4% said yes. 92% said no. 4% were undecided. 3) Do you think it is the responsibility of your representatives in Congress to pass a balanced federal budget%3f 88% said yes. 7% said no. 5% were undecided. 4) Do you believe the Administrations policies are helping to create jobs in the private sector%3f 9% said yes. 84% said no. 7% were undecided. Smith said that he plans to conduct addtional tele-town hall in the coming weeks.
06.16.2010	The Congressional Reclaim American Jobs Caucus today sent a letter to Attorney General Holder regarding the U.S. Solicitor Generals challenge to 2007 Arizona law that prevents illegal immigrants from being hired in the state. The Acting Solicitor General has filed a brief amicus curiae with the Supreme Court supporting a writ of certiorari in the case of Chamber of Commerce v. Candelaria, in which the Administration argues that Arizonas law revoking the business licenses of businesses that knowingly employ illegal immigrants is unconstitutional. They wrote: We find it outrageous that you would seek to undermine Arizonas efforts to protect legal workers and ask that you withdraw this baseless brief. The briefs contention is unjustifiable, since¦the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1986 explicitly authorized states to revoke the business licenses of employers that intentionally hire illegal immigrants. In fact, the Ninth Circuit has already upheld the constitutionality of the %5b2007%5d Arizona law. The solicitor generals action is especially troubling given the Obama Administrations weak record on enforcing federal immigration laws against employers that employ illegal immigrants. Compared to fiscal year 2008, the number of administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in employer-sanctions cases has fallen by 80%, the number of criminal arrests has fallen by 68%, the number of indictments has fallen by 74%, and the number of criminal convictions has fallen by 75%. When ICE does engage in worksite enforcement actions, it allows the illegal workers uncovered simply to walk down the street to the next employer to seek employment. If the federal government is abdicating its responsibility to enforce the employer-sanctions law and protect American workers, how can the Administration protest when individual states seek to fill the vacuum in a manner explicitly condoned by Congress in federal law%3f The letter was signed by Reps. Lamar Smith (TX-21), Gary Miller (CA-42), and Sue Myrick (NC-09), co-chairs of the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus and Reps. Marsha Blackburn (TN-07), Rep. Todd Tiahrt (KS-04), and Rep. Jack Kingston (GA-01), members of the caucus. Editors Note: Text of the full letter is available here.
06.09.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith was recognized today by House Republicans for his third place finish in the 2010 House GOP New Media Challenge. 56 House Members competed in the challenge to see who could gain the most new Facebook friends; Twitter followers; and YouTube subscribers. Congressman Smith doubled his number of followers on Facebook and added significantly more Twitter followers and subscribers to his YouTube page. Rep. John Fleming (LA-04) took first prize and Rep. Phil Gingrey (GA-11) finished second. The New Media Challenge was a great opportunity for our office to think about new media tools we can use to engage directly with constituents; and how to best use social media they already turn to every day; said Smith. We have had a great response from people interested in the issues and hungry for timely information. I will continue using social media and other new tools; like tele-town halls; to stay in touch with constituents in the 21st district. On behalf of Chairman Mike Pence and the entire Republican Conference; I am thrilled to congratulate the ˜Three Kings of New Media said the Vice Chair of the House Republicans; Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
05.27.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to reports that that the Department of Homeland Security has issued a terror watch regarding possible illegal crossings into the U.S. by terrorist suspects and recruiters. The report came from Texas authorities who allegedly were warned that Somali terrorists”members of Al Shabaab, a group aligned with Al Qaeda”are illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Ranking Member Smith: For years I've been saying that strong border security is a fundamental component of national security. If we dont know who is coming into the country, we cannot ensure they're not here to do us harm. As if the terror attempts of the past six months were not enough, now it appears terrorists are being smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border. The Obama Administrations refusal to secure the border has made America less safe and more vulnerable to terrorism. If we want to prevent another tragic terrorist attack on U.S. soil, we have to stop terrorists from coming to the U.S. That means enforcing our immigration laws, not ignoring them. A copy of the news report can be found at: https://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/26/terror-alert-mexican-border/
05.26.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith met today with Mary Ellen Trevino, president and founder of P3S Corporation in San Antonio, who was selected as Small Business Person of the Year from Texas by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Mary Ellen Trevino and other small business owners in San Antonio play a vital role in the citys economy and community, said Smith. I was pleased to meet with her and congratulate her on receiving this award. Small businesses are crucial to our economic recovery, and I will continue to advocate for policies that support our nations small business owners and help them thrive. "Despite tough economic times small business owners like Mary Ellen Trevino of Texas demonstrate the resilience of the pursuit of the American Dream, said SBA Administrator Karen Mills. In Texas and across this country, small businesses are the very foundation of our local economies and the driving force behind our nation's economic recovery."
05.20.2010	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) attended President Calderons address to a joint session of Congress. After the Presidents remarks, he issued the following statement: Ranking Member Smith: I appreciate President Calderons address before a joint session of Congress and this opportunity to foster improved relations between our two countries. The President has been a good partner in battling the drug cartels, though we still have more work to do. I am pleased that President Calderon recognized our right to enact and enforce our laws. But he is wrong to suggest that Americas immigration system is anything but generous. We admit more than one million legal immigrants each year. America welcomes more legal immigrants from Mexico than from any other country. That gives America the credibility to ask that those who want to come to America do so the right way. I am disappointed that President Calderon did not use this opportunity before us to talk about what more Mexico will do to discourage illegal immigration and improve conditions so that good, hardworking Mexican citizens will want to stay home instead of coming to America. The economic and tax reforms that President Calderon discussed are important, but they are not enough to curb the flow of illegal immigration. Instead, President Calderon continues to mischaracterize and criticize domestic policies of the United States. It is not right for the president of another country to come here and criticize our nation or our states for wanting to stop human smuggling and drug trafficking, or secure our border. Officials of foreign governments should not interfere in domestic American affairs. Contrary to President Calderons statements, the Arizona immigration enforcement law expressly prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin four separate times. If those who demagogue the Arizona immigration enforcement law would just read the 18 pages of its text, they would see for themselves that it is a reasonable, constitutional approach to securing the border “ a job the Obama administration has failed to do. Arizona has every right to protect its residents and demand a secure border, as do all the American people.
05.19.2010	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton today related to the state visit of President Felipe Calderon of Mexico. Ranking Member Smith notes in the letter that officials of the Mexican government have a long history of interference in the internal affairs of the United States, particularly in regard to U.S. immigration policy. Smith asks that Clinton request Mexican officials to refrain from additional interference in the future. Ranking Member Smith said, "In their advocacy efforts on behalf of Mexican citizens living in the United States, President Calderon and other officials of the Mexican government have crossed the line and are interfering in the internal affairs of the United States. It is well recognized in international law that immigration controls are an internal matter, and not subject to international scrutiny. Yet, President Calderon has opposed the recently enacted Arizona immigration law, which in fact mirrors federal law. Mexican government officials openly talk of a Mexican government boycott of Arizona, but make no effort to prevent their citizens from going there. These latest actions are part of a long history of interference in sovereign American affairs. "American public officials have the right and the responsibility to implement an immigration policy that is in the best interests of the American people. We should be able to do so without interference from officials of the Mexican government. I urge you to transmit this request to our Mexican friends. --30” Editors Note: The letter is available at https://republicans.judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFs/051910%20CalderonClinton.pdf
05.18.2010	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to a lawsuit filed today by the ACLU, MALDEF, National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) and others challenging Arizonas immigration enforcement law. Ranking Member Smith: The special interest groups who filed suit to stop enforcement of our immigration laws are on the wrong side of the American people. When you peel back the inflammatory rhetoric and the baseless accusations made those who filed this lawsuit, you find that Arizona has taken a reasonable, constitutional approach to dealing with a problem that the federal government hasnt. The groups who filed this suit have no interest in reducing illegal immigration.
05.18.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today introduced legislation to stop runaway government spending and rising deficits that threaten economic growth. HR 5323, the SAFE (Saving Americas Future Economy) Act, will limit annual increases in federal spending to the sum of percentage increases in population growth and inflation. Smiths bill currently has 34 co-sponsors. Our national debt has reached a crisis level, yet government spending continues without any meaningful limits in place, said Smith. We cannot afford to wait any longer and need to put a stop to runaway spending in Washington. Our debt threatens our economy and our national security. We must take the necessary steps today to ensure the economic future of our nation. Putting spending limits in place will reduce deficits and lead us towards a balanced budget. Background: Smiths legislation, which limits total spending to population growth plus inflation, will reduce the deficit each year until a balanced budget is reached in six years. Between FY2008 and FY2010, the federal deficit tripled. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), these budget deficits will force the U.S. to borrow nearly $9.3 trillion over the next decade. That is a drag on the economy and a burden on every American family. The Treasury Department reports that the U.S. posted an $83 billion deficit in April, nearly four times the $21 billion shortfall recorded in April 2009 and the largest on record for that month. This proposal is a component of the Tea Partys Contract from America. Here is what the Heritage Foundation has to say about the SAFE Act. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) has proposed a commonsense approach to avoid such ruinous spending hikes. The Saving Americas Future Economy (SAFE) Act of 2010 would limit the annual growth of government to the inflation rate plus population growth rate (typically around 3.5 percent annually). Lawmakers must rein in spending in order to prevent a debt crisis like the one spreading through Europe. This requires a budget process compatible with our budget priorities. The SAFE Act provides a strong first step by capping the growth of government, and creating a framework for priority-setting and trade-offs.
05.11.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today notified the Kerrville Fire Department that they have been awarded a grant of $42;200 through the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program. The grant funds will be used to purchase interoperable communications equipment. I am pleased that the Kerrville Fire Department is receiving this funding; which will help ensure that our first responders have the equipment they need to do their job safely; Smith said. It will enhance their ability to protect Kerrville residents. The City of Kerrville and the Kerrville Fire Department are very pleased in receiving this grant and the effect that it will have on our ability to provide quality public safety and firefighter and rescuer safety through interoperable communications; said Kerrville Fire Chief Robert Ojeda. Communications is the backbone of any public safety operation; but it must be effective in order to successfully support the operation; he added. Interoperability; the ability to communicate with each other; as well as with other agencies and departments under all conditions; is an absolute necessity in order to successfully carry out the mission of the fire department; which is to protect lives and property. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered through the Department of Homeland Security.
05.10.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the following statement regarding the nomination of U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court: Ranking Member Smith: There is nothing that requires the President to replace a liberal Justice with a liberal; but unfortunately it appears President Obama is doing just that. Though Kagan has no prior judicial record for the Senate to review, her role as an Obama-insider and senior official in the Administration indicates that she shares the same liberal judicial philosophy as the President and his top advisors. But the American people dont want a Justice selected on political ideology; they want someone to uphold and preserve the founding principles of this nation. Ms. Kagan must demonstrate that she was not chosen by the President as a political ally who will rubber stamp his agenda”but as an impartial jurist who will uphold the Constitutions limits on the proper role of the federal government and defend the liberties of everyday Americans. With no judicial experience to evaluate, the Senate must conduct a thorough investigation into all areas of her record to determine her commitment to the Constitution. For example, during her tenure as Dean of Harvard Law School, Kagan supported banning military recruiters on campus because of the militarys dont ask, dont tell policy. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the arguments of Ms. Kagan and other academics. I hope the Senate will assess every aspect of Ms. Kagans record to ensure she will serve the Constitution above all else, including her own political views and the policies of President Obama.
05.07.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that Northeast Lakeview College in Universal City; Texas; received a $599;098 grant for their Mathematics Scholars project. I am pleased that Northeast Lakeview College is receiving this funding to further their Mathematics Scholars project; which has already achieved great success; said Smith. Investing in higher education is critical for our nations future. I will continue to support Northeast Lakeview Colleges academic endeavors as they build our next generation of leaders and innovators. "We are delighted to receive this award from the National Science Foundation;" says Dr. Eric Reno; Northeast Lakeview College president. "It will allow us to increase the number of Mathematics competent professionals in our community for the next generation and supports our mission of 'providing educational opportunities.'" Northeast Lakeview College is the newest of the five Alamo Colleges and the newest community college in the nation that serves more than 5;000 students from northeast San Antonio and Bexar; Comal; and Guadalupe counties. The grant was awarded by The National Science Foundation.
05.06.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called for Members of Congress to join him in affirming the constitutionality of the National Day of Prayer. Last month, U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that the congressionally-established National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional. Ranking Member Smith, along with Congressional Prayer Caucus Co-Chair Randy Forbes (R-Va.), introduced a resolution (H.Res.1273) criticizing the decision, saying that Congress has the constitutional authority to recognize the role of prayer in our nations history. The resolution has 87 cosponsors. Ranking Member Smith: Setting aside a day for prayer and thanksgiving is not an ˜establishment of religion”which would be unconstitutional”but merely the recognition of the role prayer has played in our nations history. Its a national tradition that first began with George Washington. The National Day of Prayer imposes no duties or burdens on Americans. Anyone is free to enjoy it or ignore it. Judge Crabbs decision represents a dangerous trend in our courts of eliminating any religious expression by the government. But the faith of our Founders is everywhere in America. Should we stamp out all national traditions that acknowledge faith%3f If the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional, whats next%3f The Pledge of Allegiance%3f Printing in God we Trust on U.S. coins%3f Declaring Christmas a federal holiday%3f Congress should send a clear message to the courts that we will not allow unelected federal judges to restrict the constitutional rights of Americans. Today we celebrate the National Day of Prayer, and I pray that we will have many more years to recognize this tradition that is so important to our past and our present.
05.06.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today introduced a resolution honoring the University of Texas mens swimming and diving team for their 2010 NCAA national championship. All 32 members of the Texas House congressional delegation are co-sponsors of Smiths resolution, H.Res 1336, including Austin-area Representatives Michael McCaul, Lloyd Doggett and John Carter. This is Texas 10th NCAA men's swimming and diving championship, and 49th overall national championship. I am proud to honor the outstanding athletic achievements of the University of Texas mens swimming and diving team at the 2010 NCAA championships, said Smith. UTs tradition of excellence continues to provide students with the highest quality in academics and athletics. Congratulations to head coach Eddie Reese, the entire coaching staff and all members of the team on their hard work and exceptional performance this season.
05.06.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today was honored by the American Conservative Union (ACU) for his voting record during the first session of the 111th Congress. Smiths lifetime rating from the ACU is over 92. It is an honor to be recognized by the ACU for my voting record, said Smith. I strongly believe in fighting the reckless government spending that threatens our economic and national security, upholding our Constitution and protecting the traditional values upon which our nation was founded. I will continue to stand up for those principles in Congress. This award is a reflection of Representative Lamar Smiths consistent support of conservative principles on a wide range of issues of concern to grass roots conservatives in 2009. At a challenging time when the fundamental principles on which the American system of government are being challenged, Representative Lamar Smith stands with those who are trying to preserve those principles. “ David A. Keene “ Chairman of the American Conservative Union The ACU, which was founded in 1964, represents the views of Americans who are concerned with economic growth through lower taxes and reduced government spending and the issues of liberty, personal responsibility, traditional values and national security.
05.05.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to claims by Democrats that a massive amnesty would bolster the economy and help reduce the deficit. Democrats claim that amnesty would be a good thing for the American economy. But amnesty for 12 million illegal immigrants would require American citizens and legal immigrant taxpayers to dole out billions of dollars in benefits, while allowing illegal immigrants to permanently keep the jobs theyve stolen from citizen and legal immigrant workers. Here are the facts: The total cost of K-12 education for illegal immigrant minors and U.S. born children of illegal immigrants is $28.6 billion per year (Federation for American Immigration Reform). The cost of healthcare for illegal immigrants under the new Obamacare could cost up to $30 billion. According to numbers provided by the Social Security Administration, the legalization of five million illegal immigrant couples who work for very low wages would be a $500 billion blow to taxpayers. Amnesty for all 12 million illegal immigrants would increase this figure. Low-skilled workers usually dont earn enough money to pay taxes, but they still receive a check from the IRS in the form of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Putting illegal immigrants on the IRS pay roll will actually cost the federal government money. Amnesty would devastate the economy and further burden citizen and legal immigrant families. We should put the interests of Americans first.
05.05.2010	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement today in response the Obama administrations announcement that it would extent Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for illegal immigrants from Nicaragua and Honduras. TPS for illegal immigrants from those nations was scheduled to expire in July. The Obama administration announced today that it would extent TPS for those nations until January 2012. Ranking Member Smith: President Obamas announcement of an extension of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for illegal immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua ignores stretches the definition of ˜temporary. Only in Washington, DC, would anyone call 11 years “ and counting “ ˜temporary. TPS has become a stealth amnesty for illegal immigrants. Honduras and Nicaragua have long since recovered from the hurricane damage that resulted in the granting of TPS more than a decade ago. Its time to end this stealth amnesty program and address illegal immigration.
05.04.2010	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement today after the arrest of naturalized citizen Faisal Shahzad for his terror plot to detonate a bomb in Times Square. The arrest of naturalized citizen Faisal Shahzad for his terror plot to detonate a bomb in Times Square is an example of why we must reject proposals to give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. It appears that even the background checks conducted prior to naturalization did not identify Shahzad as a national security risk. If we cannot detect a potential terrorist who submits himself to our security process, how can we expect to identify other potential terrorists or criminals who have been hiding behind their illegal status%3f The fact is that a massive amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants has the potential to legalize thousands of individuals with ties to terrorism and give them cover for their activities. History should be our guide. In the past, terrorist threats against America have been primarily by persons who came to the United States from abroad. We cannot afford to ignore this reality. Every aspect of our immigration system has been used by foreign terrorists to gain a safe haven in the United States. A massive amnesty would not only fail to address this problem, it would overburden the system with millions of more individuals whose identities cannot be known or, as a practical matter, checked. In the interest of the security of all Americans, we must reject proposals to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants.
04.30.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith voted against H.R. 2499 tonight; citing three reasons for his opposition to the bill: the flawed process it establishes; the costs it will impose on the American people; and that to some the bill is a Democratic power play. Following is Smiths full statement in opposition to the bill: Mr. Chairman; there are at least three reasons to oppose this bill; any one of which should be persuasive. First; it rigs a proposed new referendum to force Puerto Ricans to choose what they have voted against four times in the past “ statehood. It does not provide Puerto Ricans with a fair; straightforward way to choose among statehood; independence and remaining a commonwealth. The bill also allows U.S. citizens who are natives of Puerto Rico to vote in the referendum even if they now live in the United States%21 Second; the poverty rate in Puerto Rico is almost 45%; twice that of the poorest state; Mississippi. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 1990 that if Puerto Rico were to become a state; federal entitlement and welfare costs for Puerto Rico would jump by 143%. And that was 20 years ago. If Puerto Rico becomes a state; the additional costs to American taxpayers of government benefits are likely to be tens of billions of dollars. But no cost analysis has been released. One can only guess why. Third; lets acknowledge that to some this bill is a Democratic power play. The Pew Hispanic Center reported in 2008 that 61% of Puerto Rican registered voters were Democrats; 11% were Republicans and 24% were independents. If Puerto Rico becomes a state; it is highly likely it will elect two Democratic Senators and four or five Democratic House Members. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill for any or all of these reasons. Click here to watch Smiths floor speech on the legislation.
04.29.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith this week held two telephone town meetings with his Bexar County constituents. He uses the new technology; also known as a tele-town hall; to stay in touch with constituents when he is in Washington for votes. The response from constituents has been tremendous; said Smith. Through this forum I can reach out to people in the comfort of their own homes; hear from them on the issues of the day and address their questions and concerns. Its one of the best ways I can stay in touch with my constituents while Im in Washington and it helps me to do my job better. The automated call went out to Smiths constituents in Bexar County asking them to participate in a live telephone town meeting. After some opening remarks; Smith took questions from participants throughout the county. Over 5;000 residents of Bexar County participated in the two one-hour telephone meetings. He also asked four poll questions; the results of which were tabulated by the tele-town meeting technology: 1) Regarding the health care bill recently enacted; do you believe your health care will be better or worse as a result%3f 14% said their health care would be better. 79% said their health care would be worse. 7% said they did not know or didnt have an opinion. 2) To reduce our nations deficit; do you support a cap on federal spending%3f 75% said yes. 17% said no. 8% said they did not know or didnt have an opinion. 3) Do you believe that the National Day of Prayer is Constitutional%3f 85% said yes. 8% said no. 7% said they did not know or didnt have an opinion. 4) Do you believe Puerto Rico should become a state%3f 21% said yes. 57% said no. 22% said they did not know or didnt have an opinion. Smith said that he plans to conduct addtional tele-town hall in the coming weeks.
04.26.2010	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement in response to reports that Governor Jan Brewer signed a new immigration enforcement bill into law. Ranking Member Smith: Arizonans are no different from other Americans “ they want to see the nations immigration laws enforced. They are rightly concerned about the jobs that illegal immigrants take from citizens and legal immigrants; about their communitys safety, especially after Mr. Krentzs murder; and about the substantial costs to taxpayers from illegal immigration. Pro-amnesty groups and the Obama administration may not like the new law, but they have nobody but themselves to blame for it. The fact is that Arizona is on the front lines of the illegal immigration battle. But there are numerous examples of the Obama administrations failure to enforce the law “ limits on the successful 287(g) program, substantial drops in worksite enforcement activity, and continued violence at the border. Good for the Governor and the legislature for seeing the writing on the wall. They recognized that the only way to get the job done was to do it themselves. And, since they have the inherent authority to do it, they are rightly doing whats good for the people of their State. If the Obama administration continues to refuse to enforce the nations immigration laws “ even with Arizonas former Governor at the helm “ it should not be surprised if more Governors and legislatures follow suit.
04.22.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Darrell Issa today asked nine auto CEOs to answer questions about the relationship between secret negotiations with the Obama Administration on setting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and government aid to the auto industry including the use of government ownership stakes in Chrysler and GM. It is unclear whether the Administration used leverage created by the possibility of a taxpayer bailout of GM and Chrysler to secure their cooperation and support for new fuel economy standards. Moreover, there is reason to believe Administration officials used inappropriate tactics to ensure broad based support across the industry, wrote Issa and Smith. Given the clear conflict-of-interest issues at play, which naturally arise when the government is in a position to pick winners and losers and impact the future viability of private entities, it was imperative that the Administration act with the utmost transparency. Instead, the White House imposed an unprecedented level of secrecy. According to one participant to these negotiations, the Presidents Environment and Energy Czar, Carol Browner, imposed a vow of silence over the negotiations that included representatives from Chrysler and General Motors (GM), the United Autoworkers, and California Air Resources Board Chairman Mary Nichols, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The White House has steadfastly refused to respond to two previous letters asking whether the Energy and Environment Czar violated the mandates of the Presidential Records Act when she orchestrated the secret negotiations. Click here to read an example of the letters sent to the CEOs of General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Toyota North America, BMW North America, Volkswagen of America, Nissan North America, American Suzuki, and American Honda. The letter requests a response by May 5, 2010.
04.22.2010	Today the Justice Department announced that it will appeal U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabbs ruling that found the National Day of Prayer to be unconstitutional. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) released the following statement applauding their decision: Ranking Member Smith: The Justice Department today made the right decision to defend the constitutional right of Congress to establish a National Day of Prayer. Setting aside a day to honor a religious practice of many Americans throughout history is in no way unconstitutional. Every American is free to either enjoy it or ignore it. Recognizing prayer has been a national tradition since George Washington. That's why I introduced a resolution this week upholding the National Day of Prayer as constitutional. I urge Members of Congress to sign on to this resolution in defense of the rights of all Americans to have a day honoring the role prayer has played in American history.
04.20.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Congressional Prayer Caucus Co-Chair Randy Forbes (R-Va.) today introduced a resolution (H.Res. 1273) affirming the constitutionality of the National Day of Prayer. Last week, U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that the congressionally-established National Day of Prayer is an unconstitutional separation between church and state. Ranking Member Smith: The recognition and celebration of the right of Americans to pray is in no way unconstitutional. Setting aside a day of prayer and thanksgiving is a national tradition that first began with George Washington. This is not an establishment of religion”which would be unconstitutional”but merely the acknowledgement of the role prayer has played in our nations history and the importance of prayer. The National Day of Prayer imposes no duties or burdens on any American since anyone can choose to enjoy it or ignore it. If this is unconstitutional, whats next%3f Declaring the federal holiday for Christmas unconstitutional%3f Congress needs to send a clear message to the courts that we will not allow unelected federal judges to restrict the constitutional rights of Americans. Congressional Prayer Caucus Co-Chair Randy Forbes will talk about the resolution during a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 pm ET on the House Triangle, U.S. Capitols East Front. Additional cosponsors include Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.), Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), Rep. Geoff Davis (R-Ky.), Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), and Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.).
04.16.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized the decision by U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb, which found the National Day of Prayer to be unconstitutional. Ranking Member Smith: To many American families, prayer is part of their everyday life. It is regrettable that a federal judge has called the simple national recognition of prayer--which imposes no duties or burdens on any American--unconstitutional. The decision undermines the values of religious freedom that America was founded upon. Whats next%3f Declaring the federal holiday for Christmas unconstitutional%3f The Justice Department should immediately appeal this decision. And for those Americans whose beliefs lead them to pray, I assure you that Congress will do everything in its power to protect the National Day of Prayer.
04.15.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement today: On this Tax Day, as many families and small business owners across Texas are still struggling, Democrats in Washington continue to advocate policies that spend recklessly and increase taxes. This year alone, President Obama and congressional Democrats are spending the federal government into a record-breaking deficit of $1.5 trillion. Democrats government takeover of health care, which includes more than $1.2 trillion in new spending over the next ten years, will increase taxes by another $570 billion. Raising taxes on the American people and burdening future generations with overwhelming debt is devastating to our economy. We know that we cant tax and spend our way to a healthy economy. We need fiscal discipline in Washington, and tax relief for working Americans.
04.15.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, today supported legislation to provide funding for critical homeland security measures. The Homeland Security Science and Technology Authorization Act of 2010 funds programs focused on cybersecurity, border security, chemical, biological, and agricultural terrorism, maritime security; and radiological threats. Everyday our nation faces new threats in the war on terror and our enemies constantly seek to take advantage of any loopholes in our security defenses, said Smith. This legislation will fund technology necessary to detect, deter, and disrupt future terrorist attacks. H.R. 4842 authorizes $150 million over the next two years for cybersecurity research and development. It also establishes a Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium composed of academic, non-profit, and government partners to provide training, simulation exercises, and education to state and local first responders to prepare for and respond to cyber attacks. The development of new cybersecurity measures is essential to protecting our nation from harm. I am confident Central Texas will continue to play a critical role in developing our nations most capable cybersecurity defenses, Smith added.
04.14.2010	Today, House National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee Ranking Member Rob Bishop (R-UT), House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Doc Hastings (R-WA), Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Peter King (R-NY) and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) introduced legislation to prohibit the Department of the Interior (DOI) from using environmental regulations to hinder U.S. Border Patrol from securing our border on federal lands. As a result of DOIs actions, these federal lands have become an unpatrolled highway thats open to criminals, drug smugglers, human traffickers and terrorists who endanger American lives and cause severe environmental damage. Just recently, Arizona rancher Rob Krentz was killed by a criminal who entered and exited the U.S. on federal land through the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge. This is one of the areas that Border Patrol has been unable to effectively monitor. In 2007, Rob and his wife wrote a letter to Members of Congress expressing concern over the criminal activity that was taking place in Wilderness areas along the border, writing that we are in fear for our lives and safety and health of ourselves and that of our families and friends. The legislation would ensure that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Border Patrol are permitted to assert operational control over the border in order to carry out their mission as mandated by Congress. The bill would free DHS and Border Patrol from bureaucratic interferences that currently impact their ability to effectively secure the border on public lands. The gravity of the situation must no longer be ignored. This legislation helps ensure that DOI policies no longer enable dangerous criminals to co-opt federal border lands as their drug trafficking highways. What many fail to recognize is that allowing the USBP to apprehend and deter trains of criminal traffickers will not only remedy weaknesses in border security, but also improve the health and vitality of our protected federal lands, which have been severely damaged by years of abuse from drug and human traffickers. National Security and a healthy environment are not mutually exclusive, however with current DOI policies, neither is being accomplished. “ Subcommittee Ranking Member Bishop Effectively securing our borders against illegal entry is a matter of homeland security. Border Patrol agents spend every day on the front line -- securing our homeland from terrorists. Denying or limiting the Border Patrol access to public lands and allowing the flow of illegals, including potential terrorists, doesnt protect anything. It doesnt protect the public lands that the illegals carelessly cross, and it certainly doesnt protect American lives placed at risk by terrorists who seek to exploit unpatrolled areas of the border. - Ranking Member King It makes no sense to prevent the Border Patrol from accessing these lands in the name of some future preservation. The people “ not the plants “ need our protection now, today. And by stopping the drug smugglers and human traffickers from trampling the earth and terrorizing our communities, we will preserve pristine areas for future generations to enjoy. “ Ranking Member Smith We all share the same goals of wanting to protect our environment and keep our country safe. However, Interior Department land managers are waging a turf war along the border that is making it impossible to achieve either. Today, Rep. Bishop is leading us in introducing a common sense solution that I hope will have bipartisan support. “ Ranking Member Hastings
04.07.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today notified the Kendall County Emergency Medical Service that they have been awarded an $82;512 grant through the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program. This grant will help ensure that first responders in Kendall County have the equipment they need to do their job safely; Smith said. It will enhance their ability to protect the residents of Kendall County. "The receipt of this grant will upgrade our Emergency Medical Services to a new level of excellence for our first responders and guarantee even better services for our people in Kendall County; said Kendall County Judge Gaylan L. Schroeder. We are very grateful to Congressman Lamar Smith for his care of our community and our thanks goes out to him." The funds will be used to purchase generators and protective clothing for Kendall County EMS crews. Having generators at each station will allow Kendall County EMS to continue to deliver the highest standard of care when power is out; and ensure we will still be able to conduct business as needed; EMS Administrator Jeffery Fincke said. And with the addition of personal protective clothing for our medics; we reduce the chance of injury to them while conducting patient care. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered through the Department of Homeland Security.
04.05.2010	The Office of National Drug Control Policy at the White House today announced that Travis County has received designation as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). This designation gives Travis County eligibility, as a part of the South Texas HIDTA, for Federal funding that helps to reduce drug trafficking and abuse by facilitating cooperation across Federal, state, and local law enforcement jurisdictions. The South Texas HIDTA is one of 28 such programs across the country. Congressman Smith, who serves as the Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee and represents part of Travis County, applauded the decision, saying: Todays announcement will help local law enforcement officials in their tireless fight against the dangerous drug trade that puts Travis County residents at risk. Ensuring that our children grow up in a safe and drug-free community is important for Texans across the state. These new funds will help local law enforcement officials rid our neighborhoods of drug-related crimes and violence and help keep the residents of Travis County safe. According to local law enforcement, Travis County is threatened by the importation and distribution of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine by cells of the Mexican Drug Trafficking cartels, and by the potential spillover violence from the U.S./Mexico border. Eligibility for HIDTA designation is based on the following criteria: the area is a significant area of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation or distribution; state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problems in the area; drug related activities in the area are having a significant and harmful impact in the area and in other areas in the country; and a significant increase in allocation of Federal resources is necessary to respond adequately to the drug related activities in the area.

03.23.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today agreed to cosponsor H.R. 4903, a bill to repeal the fatally flawed government takeover of health care. Congressman Smith: The American people are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats government takeover of health care because it increases premiums, raises taxes and reduces benefits. Under this bill, many health care decisions will be made by federal employees, not patients and their doctors. The result will be less care at higher cost. Congress should repeal this overreach of government control and start over on health care reform. We should focus on real reforms that reduce health care costs without limiting the rights of the American people to make their own health care decisions. Congressman Smith also joined 54 members of Congress in signing a Pledge to Repeal Obamacare sponsored by the Club for Growth. For more information about the Pledge, please visit https://www.repealit.org/ ###
03.22.2010	(WASHINGTON) “ Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted against the health care legislation. Below is a statement from Congressman Smith regarding the bill: Republicans and Democrats agree on the need for health insurance to cover those who cannot afford it. But this is the wrong way. The health care bill is built on the shifting sands of higher premiums, increased taxes and reduced benefits. Such a foundation cannot last and will be washed away by the American people in the November election. A majority of the American people want to choose their own health care plan, not have the government do it for them. Under this bill, many health care decisions will be made by federal employees, not patients and their doctors. The result will be less care at higher cost. ###
03.19.2010	Today on Capitol Hill, Members of Congress announced a new caucus that will focus on putting millions of Americans back to work. Currently, 15 million Americans are unemployed, while an estimated 8 million illegal immigrants are employed. The Reclaim American Jobs Caucus is a 40 Member, bi-partisan caucus, headed by Reps. Lamar Smith, Sue Myrick, and Gary Miller. As the national unemployment rate stubbornly hovers around 10 percent, the caucus will work to highlight the link between illegal immigration and record unemployment in the United States. If the immigration laws we have on the books were enforced, we could cut unemployment in half, Rep. Smith said. American citizens and legal immigrants should not have to compete for jobs with those here illegally. We need to turn off the employment magnet that draws undocumented workers, Rep. Myrick said. By encouraging employers to use E-Verify and increasing worksite enforcement, we make sure that Americans and legal immigrants are able to get back to work. At home in California, almost weekly I hear from my constituents that illegal immigration is exacerbating the unemployment crisis and the facts validate their concerns, Rep. Miller said. Although 2.2 million Californians are unemployed, nearly 1.9 million illegal immigrants are employed. This is simply unacceptable and is an affront to unemployed American and legal workers. The Reclaim American Jobs Caucus seeks to encourage the Obama administration to enforce existing immigration laws so that the unemployed have increased opportunities to go back to work.
03.19.2010	(WASHINGTON) “ Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement today regarding the anticipated health care vote this weekend in Washington, D.C. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that the Democrats health care overhaul will raise insurance premiums by 10-13%, increase taxes, and reduce benefits for seniors. It is a betrayal of the publics trust for Democrats to force their health care scheme through Congress when a majority of the American people are opposed. For Democrats to pass their health care bill in this manner is a corruption of the legislative process. If a new health care system is worthy of being enacted, it is worthy of being debated and voted on in an honest and straightforward way. Anything less is a stain on Congress and diminishes our great country.
03.16.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and House Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) today expressed concern over the Obama administrations continued refusal to investigate voter registration fraud allegations against ACORN. In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, Ranking Members Smith and Issa cited new documents obtained by Judicial Watch, a government watchdog group, that outline FBI preliminary investigations into voter registration fraud by ACORN during the 2008 election. The documents include internal FBI memoranda, signed affidavits, subpoenas, fraudulent voter registration cards and publications describing ACORNs policies and practices. Ranking Members Smith and Issa: The continued refusal of the Justice Department to investigate allegations against ACORN”despite mountains of evidence”raises serious concerns about the role politics plays in the Obama administrations prosecutorial decisions ¦ Unfortunately, it appears that the Presidents close ties to ACORN”and those of Justice Department officials”may be the reason why the Justice Department refuses to investigate allegations against ACORN. According to documents obtained by staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of the 137 political appointees currently working at DOJ, 21 of these (15%) have a reasonable connection to ACORN and four (3%) have a substantial connection to ACORN. Smith and Issa: Political favoritism has no place at the Justice Department. Weve already seen this administration dismiss one case against a political ally”the New Black Panther Party”for no apparent reason. We remain concerned that politicization at the Justice Department once again may result in the administrations political friends getting a free pass. In addition to requesting documents regarding shuttered investigations into ACORN, Ranking Members Smith and Issa urged the Justice Department to investigate whether ACORN is a criminally corrupt organization under federal RICO laws. Both Ranking Members also reiterated the call for a special, independent counsel to lead the investigation and guard against undue political influence.
03.03.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement regarding the Presidents plan to push the unpopular government health care takeover through Congress: The President used the line ˜If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, which has been thoroughly discredited in the media, as well as by White House officials who said that the claim cant be taken ˜literally. The President could not even bring himself to say the word ˜reconciliation, which is the tactic he plans to use to pass this unpopular legislation against the will of the American people and Congress. Reconciliation has never been used in this way without bipartisan support.
02.25.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement today regarding President Obamas so-called health care summit: The Presidents health care summit today is too little, too late: the Administration has already released its health care proposal without consulting Republicans. Instead of a summit on health care, we should have a summit on job creation or a summit on cutting spending and reducing the deficit or a summit on lawsuit abuse reform or a summit on not treating terrorists like common criminals. The Administrations health care plan raises premiums, increases taxes and cuts Medicare benefits for seniors, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Its no wonder 67% of Americans now want Congress to start over on health care. Instead of defying the wishes of Americans, the Administration should address the 15 million people who are unemployed, the millions more who have given up on finding a job, and specifically the 17% unemployment rate in the black community. The Administration should listen to the American people, not hold a six-hour photo-op on the wrong subject.
02.25.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized Democrats proposal to the Intelligence Authorization Act. The managers amendment imposes criminal penalties of up to 20 years on interrogators for the use of techniques including isolation, sleep deprivation, or even the mere presence of military working dogs during an interrogation. Ranking Member Smith: Democrats proposal gives terrorists greater protections under the law than a common criminal in the U.S. If an FBI agent in the U.S. interrogates a suspect for several hours, leaving them in prolonged isolation at times, theyre just doing their job. But under this bill, if CIA officers do the same to Osama bin Laden, they could go to prison. Its outrageous and will bring our human intelligence-gathering to a grinding halt. Its hard to believe that in the wake of an attempted attack on Christmas Day and recent warnings from national security experts of a coming attack, that Democrats in Congress would tie the hands of interrogators. Rather than thanking them, Democrats are criminalizing the very work that saves lives. Whose side are Democrats on%3f Making a terrorist uncomfortable for a few hours in order to save the lives of your family should not be a crime. Before you know it, Democrats will be pushing to house terrorists at the Waldorf and tucking them into bed with a chocolate on their pillow. This proposal is an outrage and an insult to the brave men and women of the intelligence community.
02.24.2010	Local high school students interested in attending a military service academy are invited to an Academy Day event Sunday, March 7, 2010 in San Antonio. Congressman Lamar Smith is co-sponsoring the event with Senators Hutchinson and Cornyn, and Congressmen Carter, Conaway, Cuellar, Gonzalez and Rodriguez. Academy Day will be held from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. at the University of Texas at San Antonio Campus, One UTSA Circle Main Building, Ground Floor, 0.104. Midshipmen and cadets from the U.S. Naval Academy, Military Academy, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy and Merchant Marine Academy will be on hand to meet with prospective students and their families. In addition, Academy Liaison Officers will be available. The Academy Day program will also feature information about the nomination process involved in securing appointments to the academies. Students are encouraged to submit their applications during their junior year of high school to the United States Representative in whose district they reside and to both U.S. Senators from Texas. Congressional staff members will be at the Academy Day event to assist prospective applicants.
02.23.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement today regarding President Obamas so-called health care summit scheduled for Thursday: This week, the administration will hold a health care summit. It appears that this is just a photo op and not a real effort to reform health care. For example, the administration has refused to start over on a health care bill with bipartisan input. In fact, before the scheduled summit, the administration released its own partisan draft legislation, a bill the president is prepared to ram through Congress without adhering to regular Senate rules and without Republican support. The bill contains the same tax increases, mandated penalties, cuts to Medicare, increases in premiums and a government takeover of health care as that passed by House Democrats earlier this Congress. So I remain skeptical of the administrations intentions. With 15 million Americans out of work, the first priority should be to create jobs. A jobs summit before a health care summit would address the real concerns of American families. I do support health care reform, but this bill goes far beyond fixing the problems we all know need to be addressed. Any health care legislation should reduce health care costs and ensure that our health care system is more accountable and accessible to patients. I supported an alternative plan in the House that would have expanded access to affordable health care coverage for Americans without increasing premiums and taxes or cutting benefits to seniors. It included medical liability reforms modeled after the successful reforms of several states, including Texas, which would save more than $54 billion in unnecessary health care costs.
02.23.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized Attorney General Holders claim that the plea of Najibullah Zazi is proof that the federal courts can successfully handle the Gitmo terror trials. Ranking Member Smith: The Attorney General claims that the plea of Zazi is proof that federal courts can handle the trials of terrorists currently held at Guantanamo Bay. But comparing the prosecution of Zazi”a legal permanent resident of the U.S.”to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed”who engaged in an act of war against the U.S. by plotting the mass murder of Americans on 9-11”is misleading at best. By transporting Gitmo terrorists to the U.S. for prosecution, the Administration is granting detainees broad constitutional rights that they otherwise do not possess. Zazi, however, already had these rights as a legal resident of the U.S. apprehended inside the U.S. The American people are overwhelmingly opposed to bringing Gitmo detainees to the U.S. for trial. Americans do not owe KSM and the 9-11 conspirators any more rights or freedoms than they are being afforded at Guantanamo Bay. They are enemies of America, not American citizens or legal residents. They should be tried as enemies in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay.
02.23.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced a bill to bar Guantanamo Bay detainees from entry into the U.S. The Keep Terrorists at Bay Act of 2010 (H.R. 4648) closes the legal means by which the Administration can bring terrorists into the U.S. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Obama administration has two ways it can bring terrorists into the U.S for trial. It can either waive the terrorism bars in the INA and admit Gitmo detainees as non-immigrants or it can parole the terrorists into the U.S. The Keep Terrorists at Bay Act prevents terrorists from being brought to the U.S. for any purpose, including trial and detention. If passed, the bill would prohibit Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and the other 9-11 conspirators from being transferred to the U.S. for trial. Ranking Member Smith: If the Obama administration persists in bringing terrorists to the U.S., then they leave Congress no choice but to remove their authority to do so. Guantanamo Bay was never meant to be an Ellis Island. Our immigration laws are not intended to facilitate the migration of terrorists to the U.S. Trying terrorists at Guantanamo Bay is the safest and most effective option. This bill puts an end to the Administrations ill-advised plan to bring Gitmo terrorists to the U.S. for trial, where they can get the same constitutional rights that citizens have. The Department of Homeland Security can parole aliens into the U.S. on a temporary basis for either humanitarian or significant public benefit. Parole is not a formal admission; however, the parolees ability to leave after the term of the parole depends on the willingness of another nation to accept them. In the case of the Gitmo terrorists, we have already seen that it is difficult to convince other nations to take them; and the nations that are willing cannot ensure they will not return to terror activities. In addition to barring admittance for terrorists, the Keep Terrorists at Bay Act prevents courts from ordering the release of Gitmo detainees into the U.S. In 2008, a federal judge ordered the release of 17 Gitmo detainees (Uighurs) into the U.S. Last year, a federal appeals court overturned the decision. The case is now pending before the Supreme Court. This bill says that federal courts do not have the authority to determine eligibility for entry into the country. Ranking Member Smith was joined in introducing the bill by House Intelligence Ranking Member Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.), Homeland Security Ranking Member Peter King (R-N.Y.), House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security Ranking Member Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), Chairman of the Republican House Policy Committee Thaddeus McCotter (R-Mich.), and Representative Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.).
02.17.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement on the one-year anniversary since the so-called stimulus bill was signed into law by President Obama: There is no reason to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the so-called stimulus bill. The Administration proposes to spend $862 billion with this legislation. That amounts to almost $6,000 for every taxpayer in America. We would have been far better off giving every taxpayer that amount of money to spend and invest rather than letting the Government to spend it for them. When the stimulus plan was considered, the Administration promised that unemployment would stay under 8%. Instead it is now nearly 10%. Since the stimulus plan was enacted, more than three million jobs have been lost. Fifteen million people are now out of work. In Texas, the administration projected that our state would gain 260,000 jobs. Instead we have lost 160,000. Unemployment has gone from 6.5% to 8.3%. Everything the administration claimed about the stimulus has proved untrue.
02.16.2010	This week, which is the Presidents Day district work period for Members of Congress to visit with their constituents, Congressman Lamar Smith has scheduled a series of employee forums at local businesses. Smiths Texas Means Business tour will focus on the keys to economic growth and job creation, including the proper role of government. With 5.19% unemployment, the 21st District of Texas is weathering the economic downturn far better than the nation (9.7%) and high tax and spend states like California (12.4%). Smith believes that the limited government of Texas and its low-tax climate is a big reason for the difference and that the Obama Administration needs to take notice.

02.04.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith today voted for H.R. 4061, the Cybersecurity Enhancement ACT of 2009, which passed the House 422 to 5. The bill seeks to improve cybersecurity in the federal, private, and public sectors through better coordination and prioritization of federal cybersecurity research and development activities. This bipartisan legislation strengthens key pillars of our cybersecurity defenses, including research and talent, said Smith. Central Texas, which possesses an abundance of cybersecurity expertise, will play a vital role in this important national security initiative. According to Dr. Frederick R. Chang, director of the Center for Information Assurance and Security, and a research professor in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin, It is an inexorable trend that more data and information processing critical to the nations operation are being performed by complex computing systems and sophisticated, interdependent networks. This national critical cyber infrastructure is facing an unprecedented threat level today. Cybersecurity is a pressing national priority. Enhanced understanding of cybersecurity challenges, expanded educational opportunities, increased focus on R&D and better technology are vitally important at this time. According to Dr. Lynda Y. de la ViÃ±a, Dean of the College of Business at UTSA, The passage of H.R. 4061 is especially significant to UTSA, an NSA designated Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education and Research. In particular this bill places an emphasis on the education and training of our future cybersecurity workforce, which is a major thematic in the College of Business. The college is focused on the educational needs of the nation in this critical area and is the only business school in Texas offering bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in IAS. Dr. Robert Gracy, Vice President for Research at UTSA stated, We are particularly pleased with H.R. 4061 as a well-designed, comprehensive approach to improving the infrastructure for cyber security through research, the development, technical standards, and the training of our workforce in cyber security. UTSA is very proud of the national leadership it offers in research and trainings through its multidisciplinary Institute for Cyber Security (ICS) and its Center for Infrastructure Assurance (CIAS).
02.01.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the following statement regarding the Obama Administrations FY 2011 Budget request: The Presidents FY 2011 budget allocates more than $400 million to close the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay: $350 million for detainee operations”including $237 million to purchase the Thomson prison in Illinois; and $73 million for the transfer, incarceration and prosecution of detainees. But these numbers do not even scratch the surface of the total cost to American taxpayers for the Presidents ill-advised campaign promise to try terrorists in the U.S. The prosecution of the 9-11 conspirators will take years and the cost of the actual trial”including security, transportation and detention”will far exceed the funds in the FY 2011 budget. The real cost will be to the safety and security of Americans who will be endangered by the decision to close Gitmo and transfer terrorists to the U.S. All of this additional spending is unnecessary when the Administration could treat terrorists as enemies of our country and try them in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. Gitmo is a bought and paid for facility that can be run at a low cost and with guaranteed security for the American people. It also ensures that terrorists will not be brought to the U.S. where they will be able to use the rights afforded to criminal defendants to obtain lighter sentences and broadcast their terrorist agenda from center stage. Trying to close Gitmo has not made America safer. There were more attempted terrorist attacks in 2009 than in any year since 9-11. We should be spending money on efforts to deter terrorists, not paying for lawyers to defend them.
01.29.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to reports that the Obama administration is rethinking holding the trial of the 9-11 terrorists at a federal courthouse in Manhattan. The decision to relocate the trial comes after Mayor Bloomberg publicly announced his opposition to the trial being held in lower Manhattan due to cost and security concerns. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement, urging the President to rethink his plan to bring terrorists to the U.S.: I am pleased by reports that the Administration is rethinking locating the terrorists trials at the courthouse in lower Manhattan. This is a good step in the right direction. As Mayor Bloomberg made clear, the security concerns and cost of the trial to the city are significant burdens that New Yorkers should not have to bear. However, the larger problem with bringing terrorists to the U.S. is that once they are on U.S. soil, they will be given access to additional constitutional rights, making it harder for prosecutors to obtain a conviction. Terrorists are enemies of our country, not common criminals. They should not be given the same rights that they sought to destroy. Terrorists should be tried in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay is a military detention facility for terrorists on an island far away from the American people. It is the best option with regard to cost and security. It also ensures that terrorists will not be able to use the rights afforded to criminal defendants to obtain lighter sentences or broadcast their terrorist agenda. I hope the President will not just rethink whether to have the trials in Manhattan, but whether to have the trials in the U.S. at all. We have a better chance of successfully and safely prosecuting terrorists in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay.
01.28.2010	Congressman Lamar Smith, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, said that President Obamas actions on spending, jobs and national security speak louder than his words: Out of Control Spending: After one year in office the President has increased spending by 66% and tripled the annual deficit “ the amount the government has overspent (from $458 billion to $1.4 trillion). The national unemployment rate has grown from 7.7% to 10.0%. The Presidents proposed spending freeze is a good first step, but the freeze only applies to one-eighth of the budget, only starts after the next election, and it wont apply to the Democrats unpopular and costly health care proposals. American Jobs Held By Illegal Immigrants: We could cut the unemployment rate in half simply by enforcing immigration laws. Unfortunately, the Obama administration continues to ignore the eight million illegal immigrants holding jobs that rightfully belong to out-of-work citizens and legal immigrants. National Security: Despite the Presidents attempts to reassure the American people about national security, his policies speak louder than his words. The Presidents policies endanger Americans. There were more attempted terrorist attacks last year than in any year since 9-11. Trying to close Guantanamo Bay has not made America safer. Releasing terrorists and giving detainees constitutional rights weakens our ability to prevent future attacks.
01.26.2010	House Republicans today introduced legislation requiring the Justice Department (DOJ) to consult with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense before giving terrorists Miranda rights. The Ensuring the Collection of Critical Intelligence Act of 2010 (H.R. 4503) requires DOJ to consult with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense before mirandizing or charging a foreign terrorist as a criminal. Ranking Member Smith: The Presidents policy of appeasing terrorists has failed. As we saw on Christmas Day, closing Gitmo has not made America safer. Giving terrorists constitutional rights ignores the seriousness of the threat from al Qaeda”these are acts of war, not isolated incidents of crime. All terrorists should be interrogated by intelligence experts to obtain crucial information about future attacks. Anything less risks the safety and security of the American people. Following the Christmas Day bombing plot, Nigerian terrorist Abdulmutallab admitted to FBI agents that he was an al Qaeda operative who had received explosives training from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Despite confessing to being a foreign terrorist affiliated with al Qaeda, Abdulmutallab was informed of his Miranda rights and charged as a civilian criminal. Neither the FBI nor DOJ consulted with the intelligence community before filing the complaint. According to news reports, Abdulmutallab claimed to be one of many terrorists training with al Qaeda to attack Americans. But now that he has been given access to an attorney, Abdulmutallab has stopped cooperating with investigators. In other words, our ability to gather critical intelligence about pending attacks against Americans has been lost. A recent Investors Business Daily poll found that 61% of those polled oppose giving Miranda rights to captured terrorists. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was joined by 17 Republicans in introducing the bill today, including: Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio), House Republican Conference Secretary John Carter (R-Texas), Armed Services Ranking Member Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), Homeland Security Ranking Member Peter King (R-N.Y.), Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R- Fla.), Judiciary Committee Members Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.), Howard Coble (R-N.C.), Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.), Daniel Lungren (R-Calif.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), and Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), and Congressmen Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) and Don Manzullo (R-Ill.). Representative Manzullos District includes the Thomson prison, which is slated to be the future home of as many as 50 Guantanamo Bay terrorists.
01.26.2010	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Congressman Gary Miller (R-CA), both members of the newly-formed Reclaim American Jobs Caucus issued the following statement today in response to a report commissioned by the Chicago Urban League and the Alternative Schools Network. Among other findings, the study found: During the course of the 2007-2009 recession, the employment rate of the nations teen%5bs%5d feel steeply to 26.2% by October-November 2009, setting new record lows each year. No other age group has experienced employment declines of this magnitude in the current recession. Young adults 20-24 years old in both Illinois and the nation also have been adversely affected by the deterioration in labor market developments in the state and nation in recent years, especially men, Blacks and Hispanics, and non-college graduates. Representatives Smith and Miller noted that these are the same Americans who often face the most competition for jobs from illegal immigrants. Ranking Member Smith: The fact is that illegal immigrants take jobs from American workers, particularly poor and disadvantaged citizens and legal immigrants. The best outcome for low-skilled citizen and legal immigrant workers is the removal of the illegal immigrant population. The very jobs that illegal immigrants occupy rightfully belong to out of work citizens and legal immigrants. With 15 million Americans out of work, we need to enforce immigration laws and oppose amnesty for 12 million illegal immigrants. We must stand up for citizens and legal immigrants. Congressman Miller: At home in California, almost weekly I hear from my constituents that illegal immigration is exacerbating the unemployment crisis. Todays report that a record number of young Americans are jobless once again highlights the fact that we must enforce our current immigration laws to ensure illegals do not take away jobs that rightfully belong to American and legal workers.
01.08.2010	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement responding to the White House review of the Christmas Day terrorist attempt. Ranking Member Smith: The best way to prevent a terrorist attack on U.S. soil is to stop terrorists before they reach the U.S. Even the President said that airport screening measures are not foolproof. The first line of defense against foreign terrorists is our visa process”which clearly broke down in the Christmas Day plot and almost cost the lives of 290 innocent individuals. But the Christmas Day attack is not the first time terrorists have obtained U.S. visas. Several of the 9/11 hijackers did so as well. The Christmas Day terrorist attack is a grim reminder that the terrorist threat is alive and well, and that our work is not yet done. To keep the American people safe, we must address any loopholes in our visa process immediately. The American people must be reassured that dangerous terrorists like Abdulmutallab cannot exploit our immigration process by obtaining visas that allow them to travel into the U.S. Congress and the Administration have a solemn responsibility to immediately address this failure in process and protect the American people. On January 6, Ranking Member Smith joined other top Republicans in sending a letter to President Obama outlining steps to help keep Americans secure. As part of the recommendations, the members called for the immediate cessation of Gitmo transfers to Yemen and other countries with governments unable to detain, rehabilitate or monitor returned detainees. Earlier this week, the Pentagon reported that the recidivism rate of released Gitmo detainees has increased from 14% to 20%.
12.22.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement on Senate efforts toward a government takeover of health care: To pass this health care bill, which was written in secret negotiations closed to the public and media, the Senate Majority Leader is using the taxpayers money to buy the votes of key Senators. Its small wonder that he resorted to shameless bribery. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, this train wreck of a bill increases health care costs, increases taxes, cuts Medicare benefits, reduces health care choices, and burdens already struggling states with an unfunded expansion of Medicaid. Such disgraceful tactics are a slap in the face to the majority of Americans who oppose this bald-faced effort to grow the government to gargantuan proportions.
12.17.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and House Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) today received notice that the GAO will investigate ACORNs use of federal funds. In a letter dated December 7, 2009, the GAO agreed to work with executive branch Inspectors General to provide Congress with a report regarding ACORNs receipt and use of taxpayer dollars. Ranking Members Smith and Issa issued the following statements applauding the GAOs decision: Ranking Member Smith: I am pleased that the GAO has agreed to review ACORNs receipt and use of federal funds. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that no taxpayer dollars are allocated to an organization supporting or engaged in criminal conduct. The GAO review is a good start, but given ACORNs extensive record of criminal conduct, the FBI must also step in. Only an independent criminal investigation conducted by the FBI can get to the bottom of the nationwide allegations against ACORN. Ranking Member Issa: ACORNs criminal acts over many years have robbed taxpayers and charitable donors of the honest public services ACORN was paid to provide. This GAO study should be another step toward understanding the scope of funds from across the Federal government that were sent to ACORN yet cannot be verified that they were used as intended. ACORN is currently under investigation in more than a dozen states. Many members of the organization and its affiliates have been convicted of criminal conduct, including voter registration fraud. Following the release of undercover videos showing ACORN employees encouraging criminal conduct, Congress voted overwhelmingly to prohibit the provision of federal funds to ACORN. Last week, a federal court struck down the provision as a bill of attainder. Ranking Members Smith and Issa have called on DOJ to appeal the decision. The GAO, often called the congressional watchdog, is a nonpartisan agency that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars.
12.17.2009	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined House Republicans in criticizing the EPAs recent endangerment ruling on carbon dioxide. The EPAs ruling will strike a devastating blow on the already struggling American economy. Ranking Member Smith, along with his Republican colleagues, today announced plans to introduce a resolution disapproving the EPAs ruling and calling for Congress to block the Administrations efforts. Ranking Member Smith: The EPAs carbon dioxide ˜endangerment rule is a clear attempt by the Administration to strong-arm members of Congress who oppose Cap and Tax legislation. Rather than see Cap and Tax fail in the Senate, the EPA has issued a not-so-veiled threat that if it isnt passed, something far worse will be put in place. The new rule is so invasive that it will produce the regulation of virtually anything with a CO-2 byproduct”except human breath. Companies that cannot comply with new emissions rules will be shut down, devastating the economy and killing American jobs. Texas will be one of the states most harmed by the rule. Texas utilities and construction companies, farmers and small business owners will have to prove to Big Brother that they are within new guidelines established by government employees in Washington. The world has failed to reach consensus on climate change. Forcing Americans to curb our CO-2 emissions unilaterally puts us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries and will result in American jobs being sent overseas. Congress must oppose EPAs rule, which is an overreach of authority that kills American jobs and further burdens American workers. Republicans plan to introduce the resolution when the House returns in 2010.
12.09.2009	Republican Proposal Would Require DOJ to Produce Documents on Terrorist Trials After a two-hour of debate, House Judiciary Committee Democrats today voted down a Republican resolution of inquiry (H. Res 920) that would require the Justice Department to provide Congress with information regarding the decision to transfer, detain and prosecute Gitmo detainees in the U.S. Specifically, the resolution sought information regarding what additional rights may be granted to terrorists who are brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution. Fourteen of the 16 Republicans on the Committee spoke in favor of the resolution. In his statement before the Committee, Ranking Member Smith”who introduced the resolution last month”urged his colleagues to support the proposal, saying: Never before in U.S. history has an enemy combatant”who was caught on the battlefield fighting and killing Americans”been tried in a U.S. civilian court. Unfortunately, this decision appears to be based on the liberal ideology that terrorists deserve the same rights as citizens. Once on U.S. soil, terrorists can argue for additional rights that may make it harder for prosecutors to obtain a conviction. KSM and the other 9-11 conspirators should be treated as enemies of America, not everyday criminals. They should be tried in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. During testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Holder said he believes a U.S. court, rather than a military commission, gives the government its best chance for success. This is contrary to common sense. In the case of the 9-11 conspirators, there was already guaranteed success. Before President Obama announced his plan to close Gitmo, KSM and his co-conspirators planned to plead guilty to charges and proceed to execution. But the Obama administration decided to forgo the military commissions, giving the 9-11 conspirators a second chance. A military commission trial would take half as long, be more likely to succeed, and be less risky for the American people. By trying terrorists in civilian court, the Administration is granting the 9-11 conspirators rights far beyond those provided under the Geneva Conventions, namely the full rights of domestic criminal defendants. The resolution also requests documents relating to the detention, transportation and incarceration of these terrorists before, during and after the trial. The House Judiciary Committee adversely reported the resolution by a party line vote of 20-13. Ranking Members of both the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees also introduced Gitmo resolutions of inquiry last month. The Homeland Security resolution will be considered today during the Committee markup.
12.08.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) applauded todays appointment of Judge William H. Webster to lead an independent investigation into the FBIs actions prior to the November shooting at Fort Hood in Texas. Thirteen individuals were killed and 42 were wounded in the attack. Ranking Member Smith issued a statement following the announcement: I am pleased to see that FBI Director Mueller has appointed Judge William H. Webster to conduct an independent review of the FBIs actions leading up to the shooting at Ft. Hood. Judge Webster is exceptionally qualified to lead the investigation. The tragedy of Fort Hood is a solemn reminder to all Americans that we must remain vigilant against the threat of home-grown terrorism within our communities. Unfortunately, it appears that while intelligence officials were aware of concerns relating to Major Nidal Hasan, no one raised the red flag. We must do everything in our power to protect the men and women of our Armed Services from individuals within their own ranks like Hasan. Pending the results of Judge Websters review, Congress stands ready to help our intelligence community ensure that this never happens again. Major Hasan has been charged with 13 counts of murder and is awaiting trial.
12.03.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today released the results of a new constituent phone survey conducted over the past two weeks. This technology and the questions asked were approved by the bipartisan House Franking Commission as a way for Members of Congress to interact with their constituents. With one of the fastest growing Congressional Districts in the country; Im always looking for new and better ways to hear from my constituents; said Smith. My goal is to offer as many ways as possible to interact with me and my office. In addition to phone calls; conventional mail; and face to face meetings; I have a robust website; which enables constituents to send me an e-mail; subscribe to my e-newsletter; and access my Facebook; Twitter and YouTube pages; said Smith. And when Im in Washington for votes; I regularly conduct live tele-town hall meetings; which are conference calls where constituents ask me questions and make comments. The latest survey technology; which Smiths office utilized for the first time this past week; has the added advantage of reaching constituents on mobile phones; which is significant because more and more individuals; particularly young people; do not have land-lines. Weve heard from numerous constituents who say that they would like to participate in our tele-town meetings; but they cant because some technology only calls land-lines; said Smith. This new option allows us to reach out to mobile phone users; share some of my positions on issues and get valued feedback. 64;000 people participated in the survey. Here are the questions and results: • I voted NO on the Democrat Health Care Plan and will do so again if given the chance. I do not support government regulated health insurance in America. Do you want me to continue to oppose the government regulated health insurance plan%3f Yes: 71% No: 29% • Under the health care plan that Democrats passed; if you do not buy the government prescribed health insurance you can be fined or put in jail for up to 5-years.* Do you want the government to have the power to make you buy health insurance%3f Yes: 15 % No: 85% • The Democrats health insurance plan would require you to pay up to 12% of your income for health insurance every year.** I consider this a tax increase on working families. Would you be willing to pay 12% of your income to the government regulated health insurance fund%3f Yes: 14% No: 86% • Do you support a national energy tax; also known as cap and trade; which could cost every family in Texas an additional $1;600 a year for energy consumption%3f*** Yes 12% No 88% • Do you think that government spending is out of control%3f Yes 90% No 10% • As your Congressman; I have always opposed tax increases.

12.01.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today to issued the following statement regarding the Presidents proposal to send additional troops to Afghanistan: I fully back our troops and their mission and will continue to support funding to ensure that our brave service men and women have the resources that they need to succeed. I stand by the Presidents decision, but I also have questions as to whether the Presidents policy meets the needs spelled out by our military commanders. Arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal, regardless of outcome, are not a strategy for victory. Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, General McChrystal, and top diplomats will testify before Congress in the coming days and I trust that they will be able to provide some answers.
11.19.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today voted against H.R. 3961, which will change how physicians are paid by Medicare. The legislation according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will increase federal spending by $210 billion and is not offset by reductions in government spending, thus adding to the federal deficit. Medicares payment system is unreasonable. It unfairly burdens physicians and threatens the ability of Medicare patients to access the health care that they need, said Smith. Thats why I continue to support a permanent fix for the payment formula and I voted for the last six temporary fixes, which were offset by reductions in government spending. However, the House Democrats approach is completely dishonest. In their just-passed government takeover of health care they cut more than $450 billion in Medicare benefits, said Smith. Any changes to the Medicare physician fee formula should have been included in that bill, yet these changes were removed as a budget-gimmick to hide costs. Smith supports the Republican amendment that will provide physicians and seniors with a 2% Medicare payment rate increase without adding to the deficit. The cost of this amendment will be offset with savings from medical liability reform and other policy changes. According to CBO, the Republican amendment will also provide a larger increase in Medicare payments to physicians. The Democrats H.R. 3961 will provide only a 1.2% increase in 2010, while the alternative amendment would enable a 2% increase per year for the next four years. Smith is also a co-sponsor of H.R. 3693, Ensuring the Future Physician Workforce Act of 2009, to eliminate the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and replace it with the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). This change would address both the rising costs of health care and the flawed Medicare payment system.
11.19.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced a Resolution of Inquiry requesting Department of Justice documents relating to the decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) and the other 9-11 conspirators in federal court in New York City. Specifically, the Resolution of Inquiry requires the Administration to provide Congress with any documents pertaining to additional constitutional and legal rights that may be afforded to terrorists brought into the U.S. for prosecution or further detention. The Resolution of Inquiry also requests documents relating to the pre-trial detention and transportation of the terrorist detainees for court appearances and post-conviction incarceration. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement along with the Resolution of Inquiry: The Administration continues to insist that the prosecution against KSM and the other 9-11 conspirators is a shoo-in. Unless the Attorney General has suddenly developed ESP, there is no way that the Administration can guarantee that these prosecutions will be successful. If anything, bringing terrorists to the U.S.”and granting them additional constitutional rights”undermines our ability to ensure that justice is served. The American people should not have to rely on merely the assurances of the Administration, they should be given the facts and empowered to make their own decision. The 9-11 conspirators are enemies of war, not common criminals. This Administration has banned the terms ˜war on terror and ˜enemy combatants. Maybe the Obama Administration doesnt see the distinction between terrorists and common criminals, but the American people do. The only way to keep Americans safe and to ensure justice is served is to try these non-citizen terrorists in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. Republican Ranking Members from the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees also introduced Resolutions of Inquiry today requesting Gitmo-related documents from the Administration.
11.18.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith Tuesday night held another telephone town meeting with his Bexar County constituents. He regularly uses the new technology; also known as a tele-town hall; to stay connected with constituents when he is in Washington for votes. The response from constituents has been tremendous; said Smith. This technology enables me to reach out to people in the comfort of their own homes; get their opinions on issues before Congress and answer their questions. Its one of the ways I try to stay in touch and it helps me to do my job better. The automated call went out to Smiths constituents in Bexar County asking them to participate in a live telephone town meeting. After some opening remarks; Smith randomly took questions from participants throughout the county. The call peaked with nearly 950 participants on the call during the hour-long telephone meeting. He also asked three poll questions; the results of which were tabulated by the tele-town meeting technology: 1) Do you favor or oppose the health care plan proposed by President Obama and the Congressional Democrats%3f 82% opposed. 14% favored. 4% no opinion. 2) Do you like the health care coverage you have%3f 85% said yes. 12% said no. 3% said no opinion. 3) Do you think that the country is heading in the right direction or down the wrong track%3f 85% said the wrong track. 13% said the right direction. 2% said no opinion.
11.18.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized testimony by Attorney General Eric Holder, saying: The Administration continues to insist that the prosecution against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other 9-11 conspirators is a shoe-in. Unless the Attorney General has suddenly developed ESP, there is no way that the Administration can guarantee that these prosecutions will be successful.

The only way to keep Americans safe and to ensure justice is served is to try these non-citizen terrorists in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay. Ranking Member Smith today joined other Republican members in sending a letter to President Obama outlining the national security concerns posed by the decision and insisting that the Administration provide responses to the American people before any terrorists are imported to the U.S. for detention or prosecution. Throughout this year, a bipartisan majority in Congress has listened to the American people and voted against importing these dangerous terrorists into the U.S., the Members said in the letter to President Obama. Republicans want to work in a bipartisan way on a comprehensive plan to keep America safe, but we will not stand by as your Administration defies the will of the American people and brings these terrorists to U.S. soil. The Republican Ranking Members also introduced a discharge petition to force a vote H.R. 2294, the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act. Republican Leader Boehner introduced the bill earlier this year, along with 169 Republicans, to require the President to notify Congress 60 days before the transfer or release of a Gitmo detainee occurs and to certify that such a transfer or release will not result in the release of any detainee into the U.S., adversely affect the prosecution of any detainee, or otherwise pose a security risk to the U.S. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.), Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Peter King (R-N.Y.) and Appropriations Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee Ranking Member Frank Wolf (R-Va.) released the letter at press conference today in Washington.
11.18.2009	Republican Ranking Members today demanded answers to questions posed over the past 10 months about the Administrations ill-advised decision to close Guantanamo Bay. In a letter to President Obama, the Ranking Members outlined the national security concerns posed by the decision and insisted that the Administration provide responses to the American people before any terrorists are imported to the U.S. for detention or prosecution. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.), Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Peter King (R-N.Y.) and Appropriations Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee Ranking Member Frank Wolf (R-Va.) released the letter at press conference today in Washington.

11.13.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to media reports that the Obama administration plans to try five of the 9-11 conspirators in Article III courts. The reports came on the same day that White House Counsel Greg Craig is expected to announce his resignation, after serving as the Presidents top legal advisor for less than a year. According to media reports, Craig was responsible for much of the Administrations failed Gitmo policies, including establishing a one year deadline to close the facility. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement, expressing concerns about the decision to bring terrorists to the U.S. and its impact on American communities: The Obama administrations decision to bring the 9-11 conspirators to the U.S. to stand trial could endanger the American people. Bringing terrorists to U.S. soil expands their constitutional rights and could result in shorter sentences. Trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM)”the alleged mastermind of 9-11”and his co-conspirators in a federal court means they can argue for additional constitutional rights, including Miranda and Fourth Amendment rights. The Obama administration has yet to respond to concerns about what to do with terrorists once they have served their sentences. Will they be deported%3f Will they be released into American communities%3f The administrations inability to articulate a plan for closing Gitmo gives me no confidence that they will come up with answers to these pressing questions. The American people must be reassured that no terrorist will ever be released into our communities. Trying terrorists in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay is the most appropriate venue and safest option for the American people. America already gives terrorists more constitutional rights than any other country. The Administration should not prioritize the rights of terrorists over the rights of Americans to be safe and secure.
11.13.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement today following Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitanos remarks at the Center for American Progress. Ranking Member Smith: First, the administration used phantom statistics about jobs created or saved to justify its massive spending spree. Now the administration credits the poor state of the American economy and dearth of jobs for reducing illegal immigration. It is ironic that a poor economy is their justification for amnesty. How can they allow 12 million illegal immigrants to take jobs that should go to citizens and legal immigrants%3f And how can they claim that enforcement is done when there are more than 400 open miles of border with Mexico, hundreds of thousands of criminal and fugitive aliens and millions of illegal immigrants taking American jobs%3f The single most effective thing that DHS could do to create jobs for American workers would be to conduct vigorous worksite enforcement and to actually deport the illegal immigrant workers so they dont remain here to compete with citizen and legal immigrant job-seekers.
11.10.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Congressman Frank Wolf (R-Va.) today sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting information regarding the status of the Justice Departments inquiry into the sudden dismissal of voter intimidation charges against the New Black Panther Party. Ranking Member Smith and Congressman Wolf expressed concern that the Justice Department is using the investigation as a means to continue stonewalling Congress in this matter. After three months of investigating, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) has yet to provide Congress with a clear explanation for why the Civil Rights Division dismissed the complaint. According to Ranking Member Smith and Representative Wolf, Congress and the American people must have confidence that the Departments Voting Rights Act enforcement is free of improper political motives ¦ it is important for Congress, in furtherance of its oversight obligations, to receive answers before the end of this year”before we enter a political season so that voters can be assured that voter intimidation will not be tolerated. Following the November elections of 2008, Justice Department attorneys filed charges against three individuals and the New Black Panther Party for allegedly threatening voters at a poll in Philadelphia. The Justice Department effectively won the case when the defendants declined to appear before the court and challenge the charges. But when Obama administration officials arrived at the Justice Department, the case against the Democratic Partys political ally was suddenly dropped%21 No facts had changed and no new evidence was shown to justify the decision, leaving the impression that politics played a role in the decision. It has been three months since OPR initiated an investigation at the request of Ranking Member Smith and Congressman Wolf.
11.09.2009	Citing Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates of $750 billion in new taxes, $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, and a cost of $1.3 trillion, Congressman Lamar Smith voted against H.R. 3962 “ the Democrats health care bill. This is audaciously bad legislation, said Smith referring to the 2,000 page bill. It increases premiums, increases taxes, cuts benefits and leads to health care rationing. The government rather than patients and doctors will make many health care decisions. Smith supports health care reform to help the long-term, low-income uninsured, but believes that can be accomplished without a government takeover of health care. This bill represents an unprecedented loss of freedom and more government control for the American people, said Smith. Instead, House Republicans introduced a health care bill that according to the CBO will lower premiums for families and small business owners, cut the deficit by $68 billion, enact tort reform, and prevent illegal immigrants from receiving taxpayer subsidies.
11.06.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith released the following statement today after the Department of Labor announced the national unemployment rate reached 10.2 percent during the month of October: What did the American people get for their $787 billion%3f Today, we have our answer: 190,000 jobs lost in October, 10.2 percent unemployment, and more than 2.8 million jobs lost since the so-called stimulus was signed by President Obama. And now, because the Democrats did such a good job with the taxpayers money in that case, theyre moving on to their next trillion dollar bill -- a plan for a government takeover of health care. What sort of results can we expect from that bill%3f According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) we can expect $744 billion in job-killing taxes, $400 billion in Medicare cuts, and higher premiums for all Americans. The American people know that we cannot and should not continue on this ruinous course. Instead, my fellow House Republicans and I have introduced an economic recovery plan that will create twice the jobs at half the costs of the Democrat so-called stimulus and we have a health care plan that will lower costs, reduce the deficit and ensure coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. The Democrats in control of our government need to listen to the American people and stop mortgaging the countrys future.
11.05.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith Wednesday night held a telephone town meeting with his Bexar County constituents. He uses the new technology; also known as a tele-town hall; to stay connected with constituents when he is in Washington for votes. The response from constituents has been tremendous; said Smith. This technology enables me to reach out to people in the comfort of their own homes; get their opinions on issues before Congress and answer their questions. Its one of the ways I try to stay in touch and it helps me to do my job better. The automated call went out to Smiths constituents in Bexar County asking them to participate in a live telephone town meeting. After some opening remarks; Smith randomly took questions from participants throughout the county. The call peaked with nearly 900 participants on the call during the 45-minute telephone meeting. He also asked three poll questions; the results of which were tabulated by the tele-town meeting technology: 1) Do you favor or oppose the health care plan proposed by President Obama and the Congressional Democrats%3f 80% opposed. 15% favored. 5% no opinion. 2) Do you like the health care coverage you have%3f 88% said yes. 9% said no. 3% said no opinion. 3) Do you think that the country is heading in the right direction or down the wrong track%3f 81% said the wrong track. 16% said the right direction. 3% said no opinion. Smith said that he plans to conduct another Bexar County tele-town hall in the coming weeks.
11.02.2009	
11.02.2009	Judiciary Committee Republicans today sent a letter to Chairman John Conyers calling for a hearing on ACORN. Specifically, Republican members expressed concern about allegations of voter registration fraud and activities that undermine the integrity of our election process. Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement urging Judiciary Committee Democrats to schedule a hearing on ACORN: As guardians of the Constitution, members of the Judiciary Committee have a responsibility to look into allegations that ACORN employees have engaged in activities that undermine the integrity of our democracy. Despite numerous allegations of wrongdoing against ACORN, including voter registration fraud, the Democratic leadership in Congress continues to stonewall Republican requests for a full investigation. The American people have a right to know the truth about ACORNs activities. Congress should hold a hearing before the end of this year. All 16 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee signed the letter to Chairman Conyers. A copy of the letter is attached.
10.30.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement after the White House again claimed that their $787 billion stimulus created or saved jobs: The White House is living in the land of make-believe, said Smith. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows more than three million Americans have lost their jobs this year. The Administration also said that the stimulus would create 269,000 jobs in Texas, but we lost 225,300. In this case, the administration is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.
10.29.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement after Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats unveiled their 1,990-page trillion-dollar government takeover of health care bill: This 1,990-page behemoth will raise premiums and health care costs on all Americans. It imposes mandates and new taxes on the middle class and small businesses. It fails to address tort reform and it dumps a huge unfunded expansion of Medicaid on the states, said Smith. Combined with budget gimmicks to hide $245 billion in costs and massive cuts to senior benefits, this is an outright deceptive bill.
10.28.2009	According to CSPANs Congressional Chronicle; Congressman Lamar Smith now ranks in the top 10 for speaking appearances on the House Floor out of the 435 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. This Congress; Smith has delivered more than 90 speeches in 60 days on subjects ranging from jobs and the economy to health care and the growth of government. Its my responsibility to speak out about the direction our country is headed and I try to take every opportunity to do so; said Smith. I want my constituents views to be known. Videos of Smiths House Floor speeches are available on YouTube.com; which can be accessed through his official website: lamarsmith.house.gov.
10.27.2009	Jail and task force models prevent crime, uphold law Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and 53 other Members of Congress sent a letter to President Obama today expressing their support for a broadly-applied 287(g) program. The letter comes just days after the Obama administration implemented limits on state and local law enforcement agencies who participate in the 287(g) program. The limits prevent state and local law enforcement officers from arresting many of the illegal immigrants with whom they come into contact. Ranking Member Smith, who co-authored the legislation that created 287(g), said: The Obama administration should not politicize this highly effective immigration enforcement and public safety program. Thanks to the 287(g) program, thousands of illegal immigrants that are identified in jails and through task force operations are being identified and deported. Claims that the program was supposed to focus only on ˜serious crimes are false. The program was created to let state and local law enforcement officials help enforce all immigration laws, not just a select few. One of the most effective things we can do to prevent illegal immigrant crimes in the first place is to deport illegal immigrants before theyve committed one, whether they are identified in jails or by law enforcement task forces. The open borders crowd doesnt like the 287(g) program because it is working -- thousands of illegal immigrants are being identified and deported. It is so popular that the Department of Homeland Security rejected dozens of applications due to funding shortfalls in the last few years. Local law enforcement agencies deserve our thanks for helping to remove illegal immigrants from our communities before they threaten American lives and property. The Obama administration should not limit local agencies ability to help enforce our nations laws. According to the letter: The 287(g) program, whether through jail intake, task force or other operational models, is effective and has been used by jurisdictions across the United States to help reduce crime and illegal immigration. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) own website states ˜%5bT%5dhe 287(g) program has emerged as one of the agencys most successful and popular partnership initiatives as more state and local leaders have come to understand how a shared approach to immigration enforcement can benefit their communities. It allows law enforcement officials direct access to the information needed, and the authority, to issue detainers and hold an illegal immigrant until ICE is available to transport the individual to a detention facility. According to ICE statistics, ˜%5bS%5dince January 2006, the 287(g) program is credited with identifying more than 130,000 potentially removable aliens “ mostly at local jails. More than 1075 officers have been trained and certified through the program.... The number of participating jurisdictions, currently at 57, has been as high as 67. Participants include local police departments, county sheriffs offices, state departments of corrections and state departments of public safety. In addition to Members of Congress, a study released this month indicates that a majority of Americans also support the 287(g) program. According to Rasmussen Reports, 64% of those surveyed believe law enforcement officers should conduct surprise visits at locations where illegal immigrants seek employment. Only 19% opposed the visits compared to 24% who opposed such visits back in April. By a 13-point margin, Americans believe that the federal government should not prevent local law enforcement from checking an individual's immigration status even if they have committed no other crime. The letter from Congressional 287(g) supporters follows numerous attacks on 287(g) by amnesty proponents. In addition to limiting 287(g) to only ˜serious criminals, the Obama administration recently stripped Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio of 287(g) task force authority. In addition, both the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the New York Times editorial board recently called for the programs termination. # # # Editors Notes: The full text of the letter is available at https://republicans.judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFs/102609%20Obama287g%20(FINAL).pdf The letters signators are: Robert Aderholt (R - AL), Todd Akin (R - MO), Rodney Alexander (R “ LA), Steve Austria (R “ OH), James Barrett (R “ SC), Roscoe Bartlett (R “ MD), Brian Bilbray (R “ CA), Gus Bilirakis (R “ FL), Marsha Blackburn (R “ TN), John Boozman (R “ AR), Paul Broun (R “ GA), Ginny Brown-Waite (R “ FL), Vern Buchanan (R “ FL), Ken Calvert (R “ CA), John Campbell (R “ CA), Eric Cantor (R “ VA), Jason Chaffetz (R “ UT), Howard Coble (R “ NC), John Culberson (R - TX), Geoff Davis (R - KY), Nathan Deal (R “ GA), Virginia Foxx (R “ NC), Trent Franks (R “ AZ), Elton Gallegly (R - CA), Bob Goodlatte (R “ VA), Gregg Harper (R “ MS), Wally Herger (R “ CA), Jim Jordan (R “ OH), Steve King (R - IA), Jack Kingston (R- GA), Tom Latham (R “ IA), Robert Latta (R “ OH), John Linder (R “ GA), Blaine Luetkemeyer (R “ MO), Kenny Marchant (R “ TX), Michael McCaul (R “ TX), Tom McClintock (R “ CA), Patrick McHenry (R “ NC), Gary Miller (R “ CA), Jerry Moran (R - KS), Sue Myrick (R “ NC), Randy Neugebauer (R “ TX), Pete Olson (R “ TX), Ted Poe (R “ TX), Bill Posey (R “ FL), Tom Price (R - GA), Mike Rogers (R - AL), Dana Rohrabacher (R “ CA), Thomas Rooney (R “ FL), Edward Royce (R “ CA), Heath Shuler (D - NC), Lamar Smith (R-TX), John Sullivan (R - OK), Frank Wolf (R “ VA)

10.22.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith Tuesday night held a telephone town meeting with his Hill Country constituents. He uses the new technology; also known as a tele-town hall; to stay connected with constituents when he is in Washington for votes. The feedback from constituents has been tremendous; said Smith. This technology enables me to reach out to people in the comfort of their own homes; get their opinions on issues before Congress and answer their questions. Its one of the ways I try to stay in touch and it helps me to do my job better. The automated call went out to Smiths constituents in Comal; Kendall; Kerr; Bandera and Real counties asking them to participate in a live telephone town meeting. After some opening remarks; Smith randomly took questions from participants throughout the five counties. The call peaked with 1;267 participants on the call during the one-hour telephone meeting. He also asked three poll questions; the results of which were tabulated by the tele-town meeting technology: 1) Do you favor or oppose the health care plan proposed by President Obama and the Congressional Democrats%3f 87% opposed. 8% favored. 4% no opinion. 2) Do you think that the President should authorize General McChrystals request for additional troops for the war in Afghanistan%3f 79% said yes. 15% said no. 7 said no opinion. 3) Do you think that the country is heading in the right direction or down the wrong track%3f 89% said the wrong track. 8% said the right direction. 2% said no opinion. Smith said that he plans to conduct more tele-town halls in other parts of his district in the coming weeks.
10.21.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the following statement in response to Democrats' PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill that weakens America's anti-terror laws: ""House Democrats' PATRIOT Act proposal is contrary to the President's requests and contrary to common sense. At a time when the Obama administration is preparing to release more than 200 suspected terrorists, House Democrats propose weakening our nation's anti-terrorism laws. That's like releasing a bank robber from prison and then requiring all banks to cut back on security. It leaves America more vulnerable to attacks. Last month, the FBI thwarted four terrorism plots against American citizens. Terrorists have not stopped trying to kill Americans, so why would we weaken the laws that help prevent attacks%3f The war on terror is not over. We must not use America's success in preventing another 9/11 as a green light to repeal our counter-terrorism laws. This legislation will return us to the days before 9/11 when our intelligence system was unequipped to prevent that horrific attack."" Key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and Intelligence Reform Act are scheduled to expire at the end of 2009. The Obama administration, which called for a full reauthorization of the provisions, has been working closely with the Senate to draft and pass a bill. Unfortunately, House Democrats appear more concerned with placating liberal interest groups than with helping our intelligence officials keep America safe. The proposed legislation allows the ""lone wolf"" provision of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act to expire, makes unnecessary changes to roving wiretap and business record authorities, and weakens national security letter authority. The bill also makes changes to delayed-notice search warrants and amends the criminal and FISA pen register statutes. None of these changes help enhance our ability to prevent terrorists attacks.
10.19.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today responded to the Justice Departments guidance directing federal prosecutors to no longer investigate or prosecute medical marijuana distributors in states where it is legal as long as the distributors are in compliance with state regulations. According to the Obama administration, federal prosecutors have better things to do. Ranking Member Smith criticized the decision because it weakens federal enforcement of drug laws: The Administrations new guidelines directing federal prosecutors to ignore local medical marijuana dispensaries that allegedly operate in compliance with state laws fly in the face of Supreme Court precedent and undermine federal laws that prohibit the distribution and use of marijuana. For the past ten months, the Obama administration has promised robust drug enforcement efforts to help address cartel-operated marijuana fields in our national parks and drug-related violence along the U.S.-Mexico border. But we cannot hope to eradicate the drug trade if we do not first address the cash cow for most drug trafficking organizations”marijuana. Illegal marijuana sales in the U.S. help fund the illegal drug trade. By directing federal law enforcement officers to ignore federal drug laws, the Administration is tacitly condoning the use of marijuana in the U.S. If we want to win the war on drugs, federal prosecutors have a responsibility to investigate and prosecute all medical marijuana dispensaries and not just those that are merely fronts for illegal marijuana distribution.
10.08.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith issued the following statement regarding the Congressional Budget Offices (CBO) preliminary score of the health care bill sponsored by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Max Baucus: Basic common sense begs the question: ˜How is it that the Federal Government can save $81 billion by spending an additional $829 billion%3f For the Democrats, its simple: raise taxes by $500 billion on employers and Americans who have insurance and cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits for seniors by more than $400 billion. Thats how Sen. Baucus and the Senate Democrats spend $829 billion and still claim to reduce the deficit. Its worse than a budget gimmick. Its robbing Peter to pay Paul. Americans who have health insurance will see their premiums go up because of a new tax on insurance policies. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the taxes on insurance companies will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums. Even with hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases and cuts to Medicare, the claimed reduction in the deficit is based on assumptions about health care costs and spending that will never hold up over time. The history of entitlements in our country is one of growth, expansion and unexpected cost overruns. Furthermore, after all of this, according to the CBO there will still be 25 million uninsured Americans in 2019. How does any of this make sense%3f
10.07.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today criticized the Department of Homeland Securitys profound lack of judgment in awarding $1 million in taxpayer dollars to ACORN. According to media reports, the funds authorized by Congress were intended for firefighters across the country. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement: It is inexcusable that federal funds, allocated by Congress to Homeland Security to help protect Americans, have been awarded to an organization under scrutiny for possible criminal conduct. The obvious reaction of ˜what were they thinking doesnt quite cover the profound lack of judgment on the part of Administration officials in this case. This calls into question whether the Administration reviews the criminal records of organizations before awarding them with taxpayer dollars. Congress has waited far too long to address allegations against ACORN, and far too many taxpayer dollars have already been awarded to the organization. Its time for Democrats in Congress to schedule hearings and get to the bottom of ACORNs abuse of federal funding. And the Department of Homeland Security should provide Congress with a full accounting of any funds that have been allocated to ACORN in the last year. Until ACORN has proven to the American people that it can be trusted again, no taxpayer dollars should be awarded to the organization. Thats why both Houses of Congress”with strong bipartisan support”voted to cut off federal funding to ACORN. The President should listen to Congress intent and ensure that no federal agency provides ACORN with funds until all investigations have concluded.
10.06.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder calling for a Special Counsel to investigate allegations of criminal conduct against ACORN. Smith expressed concern that the Presidents close political ties to ACORN may prohibit a thorough investigation by Justice Department officials. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement along with todays letter: The Presidents public support of ACORN creates the appearance of a conflict of interest and could place improper political pressure on DOJ officials to ignore allegations of criminal conduct. In fact, last year, President Obamas campaign attorney did just that. In a letter to then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey, the Obama campaigns general counsel urged prosecutors to ignore Republican concerns that ACORN was engaging in voter fraud. Because the Presidents political ties to ACORN may discourage senior Justice Department officials from authorizing an investigation, I have called on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel who is independent of the administration and free from any undue political influence. Political favoritism has no place at the Justice Department. Weve already seen this administration dismiss one case against a political ally”the New Black Panther Party”for no apparent reason. I remain concerned that politicization at the Justice Department once again may result in the administrations political friends getting a free pass. Only an independent investigation can ensure that justice is served in this case. Last month, Ranking Member Smith sent letters to Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine and FBI Director Robert Mueller calling for investigations into ACORNs use of federal funds and possible criminal violations. Inspector General Fine has opened an investigation. Ranking Member Smiths letter to Attorney General Holder is attached.
10.01.2009	U.S. Congressmen Ciro D. Rodriguez; Henry Cuellar; Charles Gonzalez and Lamar Smith today announced $3.028 million in appropriations funding for the San Antonio River Improvements Project. The money will fund the on-going river channel improvements on the Mission Reach portion of the river on the citys South Side. Our delegation has continued to make funding the San Antonio River Improvements Project one of our priorities and I am pleased this funding is now secured; said Congressman Rodriguez; who sits on the House Appropriations Committee. This project is a boon for our community; both economically and culturally; and I look forward to working with local officials to keep bringing federal resources home to Bexar County. The appropriations funding is part of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act; 2010; which passed the House Thursday by a vote of 308-114. Tom Weaver; Board Chairman for the San Antonio River Authority; which is the lead administrator of the project; expressed appreciation for the Bexar County delegations work. We are extremely pleased and grateful for the work our federal delegation has done to secure this funding for the Mission Reach Project which is so important to the San Antonio community; Weaver said. This funding puts San Antonio one step closer to seeing this project through; said Congressman Cuellar. Restoring this eight mile stretch will increase economic opportunities for the city and improve our local neighborhoods. This shows how federal dollars can have an immediate local impact; especially during these tough economic times. Congressman Lamar Smith added: The River; the Missions; the River Walk and the people are at the very heart of what makes San Antonio the vibrant community that it is. This funding will help to extend and perpetuate that vibrancy by opening the way for further economic and cultural development of these unique assets. The San Antonio River Improvements Project has been a top priority of the city and county as well as that of my office; said Congressman Gonzalez. I am very pleased that these critical dollars will assist in meeting the needs of San Antonio and Bexar County and will directly result in much-needed enhancements to the San Antonio River that will continue to make the city a top tourist; business; and cultural destination. I look forward to supporting this effort further with my colleagues in Washington; D.C. The San Antonio River Improvements Project is an on-going comprehensive project aimed to restore and improve a 13-mile stretch of the river. The eight-mile Mission Reach project extends from South Alamo Street to Mission Espada just below Loop 140 and will transform the straightened river to replicate its original shape of flow. This restoration is aimed to increase local economic development by attracting commercial and real estate development to the southern part of the city. In Fiscal Year 2008; $10 million was secured for the River Channel Improvements Project and again in FY09. Earlier this year; the project received $25.4 million in stimulus funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). For more information on the San Antonio River Improvements Project; please visit: https://www.sanantonioriver.org/overview.html
09.30.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith; who is the Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee; today congratulated the City of New Braunfels for its proactive efforts to win competitive grants for the NBPD from the Department of Justice (DOJ). New Braunfels Mayor Bruce Boyer and his staff are to be commended for looking out for the safety of their community; said Smith. The needed equipment; training and overtime for police officers made possible by these federal grants makes a real difference in the quality of life for the people of New Braunfels. $16;304 from the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program; which was awarded in September; will be used to purchase cameras; patrol bikes; educational supplies and to pay for officer training and overtime. When added to the $67;026 grant obtained from the same DOJ program earlier this year that equals nearly $100;000 in funding that the City has earned through its diligence for the NBPD. Mayor Bruce Boyer said; We have purposefully pursued opportunities for state and federal grants for which the City is eligible and we are very pleased with the outcome of these efforts through the Department of Justice. We are particularly grateful to Congressman Smith for assistance in identifying these opportunities and for his support of New Braunfels requests for grant funding.
09.28.2009	House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Spencer Bachus (R-AL), Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) sent a letter today to financial institutions requesting full and complete disclosure of funds provided to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), and any of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including ACORN Housing Corporation. Support for ACORN is not limited to the federal government, Reps. Bachus, Issa and Smith noted in the letter. Corporations provide a significant source of ACORNs operating budget. After new evidence surfaced linking ACORN to possible criminal activity, House Republicans undertook a series of steps designed to protect taxpayers, and to spotlight the role of corporations, including those that receive taxpayer support, in funding ACORNs operations. In addition to corporate contributions to ACORN, many companies have partnered with ACORN on numerous programmatic projects including Low-Income Housing Tax Credit transactions, affordable housing development and ACORNs mortgage brokerage firm, Acorn Housing Affordable Loans, LLC, Reps. Bachus, Issa and Smith wrote. In an effort to promote transparency, accountability and proper oversight by Congress, and in conjunction with the Oversight Committees ongoing investigation, we request that your corporation provide the Committee on Financial Services with a complete accounting, by October 15, 2009, of all financial arrangements that your company and its foundation have with ACORN and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The letter calls on the institutions to disclose any settlements and other forms of contracts with ACORN, the amount of funds the company or its Foundation has given to ACORN over the last 15 years, the amount of any funds to ACORN originating from TARP funds, the names of individuals who make executive decisions regarding corporate and foundation contributions to non-profit organizations, and plans to continue providing funds to ACORN.
09.28.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and House Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) today called for the GAO to investigate whether ACORN misused federal funds. In a letter to GAO Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, Ranking Members Smith and Issa expressed concern that millions of taxpayer dollars may have been used to support criminal efforts by the organization. Issa and Smith issued the following statement along with the letter. Congress cannot ignore allegations that federal funds are being used by an organization involved in criminal conduct. American taxpayers are rightly outraged and Congress has a responsibility to act. We need a full investigation into ACORNs use of federal funds and we need the Democratic-led Congress to put a bill on the Presidents desk to ensure that no future funds are received by ACORN. ACORN has a long history of ignoring federal laws. No organization with that kind of a record should benefit from American taxpayer dollars. Some Democrats in Congress have recently called for the Congressional Research Service to review allegations against ACORN. However, while CRS can compile and research, it does not have the appropriate authority or experience necessary to investigate criminal allegations. The GAO, often called the congressional watchdog, is a nonpartisan agency that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars. GAO investigators have the authority to go into each federal agency and review whether taxpayer dollars were given to ACORN, and if so, how they were used.
09.28.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) reacted today to news reports that the Obama administration plans to transfer 384 Border Patrol agents from Americas southern border to the northern border. Ranking Member Smith: The administrations latest decision is another blow to the safety and security of the American people. Problems on the southern border have not been solved. Illegal immigrants continue to come into American communities where they can commit crimes, take jobs and cost taxpayers billions in health and education benefits. Law enforcement officials continue to report that terrorist organizations have established partnerships with Mexican drug cartels. Officials are rightly concerned that drug cartels could help smuggle terrorists across the southern border into the US. At a time when violence along our nations southern border is at an all-time high, it makes no sense to cut-and-run. If 384 additional Border Patrol agents are needed for the northern border, the Obama administration should have asked for them. The Border Patrol has been increasing significantly in size ever since Republicans took over Congress in 1995. But the Obama administration only requested 44 new agents in its FY 2010 budget request. In just the last two weeks, federal law enforcement authorities thwarted four separate terrorist plots, three of which allegedly involve foreign nationals. Now, instead of moving forward to secure the border, the administration is signaling retreat. Ill-advised policy decisions that prioritize politics over national security are becoming a pattern for this administration. First, the President made a campaign promise to close Guantanamo Bay, releasing or transferring more than 200 terror suspects. Now the administration plans to weaken security on the southern border, giving terrorists and illegal immigrants more opportunities to enter the U.S. undetected. Increasing our vulnerability to terrorists and allowing illegal immigrants to take American jobs are not the ˜change the American people bargained for in 2008. Its time for this President to set aside his political agenda and prioritize the needs of the American people.
09.22.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to ACORNs appointment of former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger to lead an internal investigation into ACORNs activities: ACORNs plan to conduct an internal audit is very much too little, too late. An internal audit will only tell us what we already know: ACORN is poorly managed and has little regard for the law. The allegations against this organization go beyond mere mismanagement, they are criminal. Thats why the FBI needs to open an investigation and determine whether taxpayer dollars are being used to fund criminal conduct. Last week, Ranking Member Smith sent letters to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine and FBI Director Robert Mueller calling for investigations into ACORN. IG Fine has agreed to open an investigation into possible DOJ allocation of funds to ACORN. The letters can be found at https://republicans.judiciary.house.gov/
09.21.2009	
09.21.2009	The Justice Departments Inspector General plans to open a review into ACORNs application for and receipt of DOJ grant funds. In a letter to House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas), DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine said that in addition to investigating ACORNs receipt of funds, his office will review whether the Justice Department conducted any audits or reviews of ACORNs use of such funds. Ranking Member Lamar Smith issued the following statement regarding the announcement: As the primary federal law enforcement agency, the Justice Department has a responsibility to ensure that no organization receiving federal funds ignores our nations laws. I am pleased that Inspector General Fine has agreed to investigate whether the Justice Department provided federal funds to ACORN through its grant program. The IGs report will help Congress ensure that money allocated to support law enforcement efforts is not instead used to support criminal conduct. It is clear that ACORN has fostered a culture of corruption. With investigations of ACORN now occurring in 20 states, it is time for the FBI to open up a full scale investigation into possible criminal conduct by ACORN. Last week, Ranking Member Smith sent letter to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine and FBI Director Robert Mueller calling for investigations into ACORN. The letters can be found at https://republicans.judiciary.house.gov/News/Read.aspx%3fid=238 A copy of the letter from Inspector General Fine is attached.
09.21.2009	U.S. Congressmen Ciro D. Rodriguez, Henry Cuellar, Charles Gonzalez and Lamar Smith announced $5 million in Stimulus funding for VIA Metropolitan Transit to replace conventional diesel buses with 35-foot composite body electric transit buses. The project includes quick-charging stations to recharge bus batteries. Grid-sourced electrical energy used to recharge the bus batteries will be augmented with solar energy collected with panels procured and installed under this project. The VIA project was one of 43 winning proposals submitted by transit agencies from across the country as part of a nationwide competition for $100 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Stimulus) funds under the Transit Investments for Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reduction (TIGGER) program. Keith T. Parker, President and CEO of VIA Metropolitan Transit, said the community will benefit from emissions-free transit service. With the TIGGER grant funding, we will be able to replace three of our diesel-powered buses with new buses that are powered solely by rechargeable batteries. Because these buses have zero emissions, they offer the cleanest operating technology from the source to the road of any buses we know of anywhere in the world. This is an exciting time for the nation as we grapple with how to protect our environment for future generations, Congressman Rodriguez said. Not only will this funding clean up our air by reducing damaging pollution and emissions, it will create jobs and lead to a sound financial investment. This investment will accelerate our transit system into meeting the energy demands of the future, and this shows how cities as large as San Antonio can incorporate more energy efficient vehicles into their fleets, Congressman Cuellar said. This is a win for VIA and sets an example for the nation in how we can diversify fueling public transit in the future. This funding is key to our citys transportation future,"" said Congressman Gonzalez. VIA is leading San Antonio into the next generation by incorporating grid source electrical energy, which uses less fuel and helps protect the environment. This funding is a smart investment in our future and creates new opportunities for San Antonio businesses and a cleaner more efficient transportation system for our citizens. Congressman Smith said I am pleased to join with the San Antonio delegation to congratulate VIA for their efforts to obtain this competitive grant. This transition to cleaner public transportation will be a great benefit to the area both in terms of quality of life and our economy. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood made the announcement Monday, calling it a sign of things to come. All the funded projects incorporate environmental technologies to reduce global warming, lessen America's dependence on oil and create green jobs. The VIA project was the only Texas project to receive funding. Parker said the three composite body buses will circulate in the downtown area, and will be recharged at VIAs Robert Thompson Transit Station at the Alamodome. The electric propulsion means the vehicles will emit no greenhouse gases while in operation, but the true innovative nature of this project will be realized in the recharging cycles. When the batteries are charged, they will receive energy generated either by solar panels installed as part of this project or from West Texas wind farms as part of VIAs partnership with CPS Energy. As a result, the three new buses will provide public transportation for the downtown area that is sustainable and free of pollution. Since the ARRA was signed into law in February, more than $7.2 billion in grants have gone to transit improvements nationwide.
09.17.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith made the following statement today after voting ˜no on H.R. 3221, The Student Aid and Financial Responsibility Act, which passed the House 253-171: The House Democrats war on the private sector has claimed yet another victim. This misguided legislation abolishes the respected Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) student loan program and replaces it with a system of government-run lending directly from the U.S. Treasury. House Democrats have clearly become enamored with their own business management skills. Is it not enough that the federal government currently owns the biggest bank, the biggest insurance company, and the biggest automaker%3f At this point, House Democrats are not even attempting to conceal their contempt for the free market. They voted for control of the American energy industry with ˜Cap and Tax, theyre in the process of nationalizing one-sixth of the U.S. economy with their health care takeover, and now theyve set their sights on the FFEL. For forty years, the FFEL program has made more 200 million loans to young people pursing higher education, all at little cost to families struggling with the high cost of college. A government-run lending program would be bad for students, bad for schools, and bad for jobs. It would provide the bare minimum in services to students and families while adding layers of costly bureaucracy and mountains of additional paperwork. The parallels between this takeover of our student loan system and the Democrats plans for our health care system are startling. House Democrats and President Obama are eliminating a program that benefits millions, to replace it with a so-called ˜public option that will leave families with zero options.
09.17.2009	Legislation co-sponsored by Congressman Lamar Smith to cut all federal funding for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) passed the House today. The Defund ACORN Act was introduced Tuesday following reports of fraudulent and potentially illegal activity by ACORN. House Republicans offered the legislation, designed to block all taxpayer funding of scandal-plagued ACORN, during debate on HR 3221 this afternoon. The legislation passed 345-75. Smith issued the following statement: The American people are rightly outraged that their tax dollars subsidize this organization, which has been linked to multiple instances of voter registration fraud and other illicit activity in cities across the country. More recently, thanks to the ingenuity of documentarian James OKeefe, 25, and aspiring investigative journalist Hannah Giles, 20, further light has been shed on what appears to be a shocking disregard for the law and common decency on the part of ACORN employees.
09.16.2009	
09.16.2009	According to a recent CBS News report, the Obama administration has privately concluded that a cap and trade law would cost American taxpayers up to $200 billion a year, the equivalent of hiking personal income taxes by about 15 percent. We now have proof that the White House accepts behind closed doors what House Republicans have maintained all along “ Cap and Trade is a hidden tax increase on all Americans, said Smith. This is a broken promise on the part of the President not to raise taxes on the middle class, period. A previously unreleased Treasury Department analysis puts the total in new taxes at $100 billion to $200 billion a year or $880.50 to $1,761 per American household. This analysis, along with another memo on the issue, was recently uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The costs placed on the American people by this legislation was a key part of the debate in the House, said Smith. That the White House would conceal this information as they were promoting ˜The American Clean Energy and Security Act is pure deception. Smith voted against the legislation, which narrowly passed the House by only seven votes in June. The Senate has yet to take up the controversial bill.
09.16.2009	House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) have sent a letter to White House Counsel Gregory Craig calling for the release of information pertaining to the appointment of a number of senior Administration advisors, otherwise known as czars. According to publicly available information, a pattern of behavior and associations maintained by some individuals runs contrary to the very core of our democracy, Issa and Smith wrote referencing comments made by former Green Jobs Car Van Jones, an organization presided over by Energy and Environment Czar Carol Browner and remarks made by FCC Diversity Czar Mark Lloyd about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. There is grave concern that, in the absence of the requirement for Senate confirmation, the Administration may be appointing individuals who would not otherwise withstand Congressional scrutiny. Specifically, Issa and Smith requested information related to these czars appointment, compensation, authority, and all records and communications referring or relating to the policies and procedures by which these individuals were selected, reviewed, vetted or otherwise approved for appointment.
09.15.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that he is cosponsor of the Defund ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) Act to cut off the group from taxpayer money. The American people are rightly outraged that their tax dollars subsidize this organization, which has been linked to multiple instances of voter registration fraud and other illicit activity in cities across the country. More recently, thanks to the ingenuity of documentarian James OKeefe, 25, and aspiring investigative journalist Hannah Giles, 20, further light has been shed on what appears to be a shocking disregard for the law and common decency on the part of ACORN employees. It is a remarkable commentary on the state of the national media that two young people using their own savings and a hidden camera brought this story to light when outlets such as ABC, CBS, NBC and the New York Times were either willfully blind to corruption or did not deem it newsworthy. Its small wonder that according to a new Pew Research survey that the publics assessment of the accuracy of news stories is now at its lowest level in more than two decades of, and Americans views of media bias and independence now match previous lows.
09.15.2009	In response to recent news reports regarding ACORN activities, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called for the FBI and DOJ to open investigations into the organization. In a letter to FBI Director Robert Mueller, Ranking Member Smith requested that the FBI initiate an investigation into the activities of ACORN, including an inquiry into possible RICO violations. In a letter to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine, Ranking Member Smith requested a report on whether DOJ grant funding has been allocated to ACORN. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement along with the letters. For years, ACORN has been the subject of allegations of fraud, misconduct and possible criminal activity. In fact, voter registration fraud allegations have led ACORN to be subject to investigation in 15 states. Despite these serious concerns, Congress and the Administration continue to provide federal funding to a corrupt organization. Our democracy depends on the integrity of our election process. ACORNs efforts to swing election results through voter registration fraud undermine the integrity of our elections and shake the American peoples faith in their government. As the primary federal law enforcement agency, the Justice Department has the responsibility to ensure that no organization receiving federal funds ignores our nations laws. Additionally, there is sufficient evidence for the FBI to open a nationwide investigation into ACORNs activities. This Administration claims that civil rights investigations will be a priority for the Justice Department. I can think of no better place to start than ensuring that the voter rights of every American are protected by rooting out fraud.
08.25.2009	
08.25.2009	President Obama on Saturday continued the hard sell for the Democrats healthcare scheme with a radio address that purported to expel myths associated with the bill. There is just one problem: his statements dont match the facts. The Presidents radio address started by calling it a false claim that illegal immigrants will get health insurance under reform. But his statements are contradicted by fact. A new report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) validates that numerous loopholes may allow illegal immigrants to benefit under the bill. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith said: Democrats can keep claiming all they want that illegal immigrants will not be covered in this bill. But their actions speak louder than their words. Democrats have rejected opportunities to close the gaping loopholes in this health care bill that will allow illegal immigrants to participate. If President Obama is committed to ensuring that illegal immigrants do not benefit from the bill “ as he says he is “ why not include the same verification mechanisms in this bill as already exist for other federal benefits programs%3f Whats more, the bill contains no provisions preventing illegal immigrants from participating in the Health Insurance Exchange that is to be created, including the government-run public plan that will be available through the federally-run and federally-subsidized Exchange. This is in direct conflict with the Presidents claim that illegal immigrants will not be insured under his plan. The American people are more intelligent than the President gives them credit for. They understand that simply saying illegal immigrants cant participate without providing verification is like putting a speed-limit sign on a road, then setting a policy that prohibits police from patrolling the road; it wont stop speeders, and this bill wont stop illegal immigrants from benefitting. BACKGROUND: IMMIGRATION LOOPHOLES IN HR 3200 Open access to Insurance Exchange: HR 3200 contains no provisions preventing illegal immigrants from participating in the Health Insurance Exchange that is to be created, including the government-run public plan that will be available through the federally-run and federally-subsidized Exchange. According to CRS: Under H.R. 3200, a ˜Health Insurance Exchange would begin operation in 2013 and would offer private plans alongside a public option¦H.R. 3200 does not contain any restrictions on noncitzens”whether legally or illegally present, or in the United States temporarily or permanently”participating in the Exchange. No verification mechanism: Democrats point to language in the House bill that says illegal immigrants cannot get benefits. While that may be technically accurate, it is far from the truth. The fact is that the statement is meaningless because the bill contains no verification mechanism to ensure that illegal immigrants do not receive benefits. Democrats defeated amendments in two congressional committees to close this loophole, including amendments that would use the very same verification mechanism that already exist in statute for other federal programs. Why not include the same verification mechanisms in this bill as already exist for other federal benefits programs%3f Without the requirement that there be a verification mechanism or a specific verification mechanism provided in statute, the Commissioner could determine that the eligibility requirements could be met either without verification or with as little as a signed attestation. According to CRS: Some have expressed concerns that since H.R. 3200 does not contain a mechanism to verify immigration status, the prohibitions on certain noncitizens (e.g, nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens) receiving the credits may not be enforced. However, others note that under §142(a)(3) of the bill, it is the responsibility of the Health Choices Commissioner (Commissioner) to administer the ""individual affordability credits under subtitle C of title II, including determination of eligibility for such credits. Family eligibility for affordability credits: Section 242(a)(2) of the bill provides that %5be%5dxcept as the Commissioner may otherwise provide, members of the same family who are affordable credit eligible individuals shall be treated as a single affordable credit individual eligible for the applicable credit for such a family under this subtitle. This suggests that if one member of a family is legally eligible, every family member will be considered eligible. This is significant in terms of numbers -- the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that there are almost two million families in the United States where illegal immigrant parents have U.S.-born children. That does not include other ""mixed status families"" - one legal parent, one illegal parent and illegal child, etc. According to CRS: There could be instances where some family members would meet the definition of an eligible individual for purposes of the credit, while other family members would not. For example, in a family consisting of a U.S. citizen married to an unauthorized alien and a U.S. citizen child, the U.S. citizen spouse and child could meet the criteria for being a credit-eligible individual, while the unauthorized alien spouse would not meet the criteria. H.R. 3200 does not expressly address how such a situation would be treated. Therefore, it appears that the Health Choices Commissioner would be responsible for determining how the credits would be administered in the case of mixed-status families.
08.19.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that he will hold constituent health care forums for the 21st District of Texas on Monday, August 24 in both Kerrville and San Antonio. Smith is also asking constituents to bring their opinions in writing and he will deliver them to the White House and Congressional Leadership. Americans are doing their homework on healthcare reform. And theyre right to be leery of government-controlled healthcare that will increase costs, eliminate jobs through punitive taxes on small businesses, and put a government panel between doctors and patients. I believe Congress should pursue reform, but the legislation pursued by Democratic leaders will neither reduce costs nor improve care, said Smith. At the forums, Smith will talk to constituents about his health care priorities, listen to their ideas and concerns, and field questions. Who: Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) What: Constituent Health Care Forums When: MONDAY, August 24, 2009 Where: Kerrville 9:30 a.m. The Kathleen C.

08.19.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member today criticized the Department of Homeland Securitys decision to repeal the no-match rule, which helps employers identify individuals who may be working illegally. The proposed rule was filed today in the Federal Register. No-match letters are sent by the Social Security Administration (SSA) when an employers tax forms show names or social security numbers that do not match the SSAs files. The letters can help identify mistakes on behalf of the filers, as well as the possible illegal worker status of some employees. This is just another decision by the Obama administration to weaken immigration enforcement efforts that preserve jobs for legal workers. No match letters help employers who want to follow the law to identify employees that may be working in the U.S. illegally. There are currently an estimated seven million illegal immigrants working in the U.S. Meanwhile, there are 12.7 million Americans looking for jobs. Citizen and legal immigrant workers should not have to compete with illegal immigrants for scarce jobs. By repealing the no-match rule, the administration is putting illegal immigrants before the best interests of the American people. This proves that President Obama is not serious about reducing illegal immigration and saving jobs for American citizens.
08.12.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) yesterday issued the following statement regarding the release of transcripts from depositions with former Bush administration official Karl Rove: Despite all evidence to the contrary, House Democrats continue to falsely accuse former Bush administration official Karl Rove of wrongdoing in the dismissal of several U.S. Attorneys. But the interviews reveal no evidence of wrongdoing in the firings. Meanwhile, the Obama administration is the one that has really politicized the Justice Department. Political appointees recently overturned career attorneys decision to pursue voter intimidation charges against the New Black Panther Party for threatening voters on Election Day 2008. Dismissing charges against political allies for no apparent reason reeks of political interference. Democrats need to stop wasting taxpayers time and money on political investigations that are nothing more than the politics of personal destruction.
08.03.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $100;000 for the Witte Museum in San Antonio was included in the FY2010 Labor; Health and Human Services; Education Appropriations bill and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. The federal funding will assist the Witte Museum in launching the South Texas Heritage Center; a major component of a building and modernization campaign. The Center will be dedicated to sharing the history of the region and will house the preeminent collection of South Texas artifacts from empire ranches; small town farms; San Antonio plazas and regional oil and gas industries. The Witte Museum embodies the culture and heritage of South Texas; said Smith. The modernization efforts are an important part of preserving the history of the region for citizens; school children and visitors to San Antonio. The South Texas Heritage Center is one of three components of the planned Witte Museum campus expansion; which also includes a Collections and Research Center; a Center for Rivers and Aquifers; and refurbished physical; biological and natural science galleries and exhibits.
08.03.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $2.5 million for the National Trauma Institute (NTI) in San Antonio was included at his request in the FY2010 Defense Appropriations bill and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. The funding will be used to develop techniques to manage non-compressible hemorrhage following combat injury. Studies show that non-compressible hemorrhage from injuries to the torso is the leading cause of potentially survivable deaths of American troops. According to the Institute for Surgical Research; mitigation of battlefield injury and hemorrhage is the highest priority of U.S. military trauma surgeons; said Smith. Many of the problems associated with such injuries are potentially solvable and can be transferred between military and civilian care to save numerous lives. We're grateful for this federal support of trauma research; which we believe will lead to better outcomes for people suffering from trauma; whether here at home or in combat abroad;"" said Sharon Smith; executive director of the National Trauma Institute. Trauma injuries and deaths are at epidemic levels in the United States; and the research projects we will be able to fund; as a result of this grant; will improve our ability to reduce the rates of death and disability due to trauma. The National Trauma Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to the funding and development of research addressing trauma injury in the United States. Though trauma is at epidemic levels in the United States; many Americans are unaware that trauma is so pervasive. Car accidents; domestic violence; assaults; and natural disasters all contribute to the nations current levels of trauma injury and death. More than 170;000 of these trauma victims die each year; making it the leading cause of death for Americans under age 44. Whats more; these figures dont include the numbers of American soldiers overseas; all of whom are at increased risk of trauma.
07.31.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $1.5 million for the University of Texas at Austin was included at his request in the FY2010 Defense Appropriations bill and was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. The funding; in addition to the $1.2 million secured by Smith last fall; will be used to establish a research and education program for enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the field of next generation manufacturing processes and systems. The research will involve the use of physics-based models; state-of-the-art analysis and control; and advanced materials to develop the next generation of manufacturing. UT Austin and Central Texas have a well-earned reputation for innovation and entrepreneurship and this federal funding will build on our strengths; said Smith. If we are to keep pace in the global economy; it will largely depend on the ability of our education system to support technology transfer and commercialization. In this case; advances in next generation manufacturing will have implications for nearly every aspect of our economy. The initial focus of the program will be on flexible and rapid response next generation manufacturing processes that are critical to national defense; security; infrastructure; energy; and medical products. Innovative approaches to manufacturing such as the Next Generation Manufacturing project are crucial to economic progress and national security;"" said Juan Sanchez; vice president of research at The University of Texas at Austin. ""We appreciate Congressman Smith's efforts in securing investment in the project."" This funding underscores UTs ability not only to prepare young people for the challenges of the future; but also to contribute to and enhance our nations competitiveness; said Smith.
07.31.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $250;000 for the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) was included in the FY2010 Labor; Health and Human Services; Education Appropriations bill and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. The federal funding will be used to purchase equipment and technology for the UIWs new School of Optometry and a planned East Side eye care clinic; which will provide quality eye exams and vision services to under-served residents in East San Antonio. Texas has a great need for optometrists. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services; in 2006 there were 30;000 practicing optometrists in the U.S. and only 2;690 serving Texas more than 23 million residents; said Smith. Local need is even greater due to the significant prevalence of diabetic eye disease in San Antonio. UIWs new School of Optometry will open this Fall and the eye care clinic is expected to open in Spring of 2010. These facilities will educate new optometrists and offer clinical optometry services; particularly in the field of pediatric and geriatric optometric services. The long-range goal of the program is to increase the number of professional optometrists in Texas According to UIW School of Optometry Founding Dean & Professor Dr. H. Simon Ghazi-Birry; We are honored to receive this award and grateful to Congressman Smith for his vision and help in this public health care project. The Eastside Clinical facility is; in my opinion; what constitutes the jewel of our clinical program. We are able to serve a significant population of the underserved. We are also able to expand the mission of the university in terms of social justice; community service and the provision of healthcare. The faculty; administration and staff of the UIW School of Optometry are committed to fostering academic and clinical excellence; professional growth and community outreach. At least 50 fulltime; permanent jobs are expected to be created at the eye care clinic with the assistance of this federal funding. UIW is the fourth-largest private university in Texas. The East Side eye care clinic will be located on East Commerce Street near downtown San Antonio.
07.29.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) praised Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute for her decision to deny a petition for rulemaking related to detention standards for immigration detainees. The decision was reported in todays New York Times. Ranking Member Smith: I commend the Department of Homeland Security for its decision to deny a petition for rulemaking related to detention standards for immigration detainees. I also appreciate the fine efforts of the men and women of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) who work every day to safely and humanely enforce our nations immigration laws. This decision will prevent a flood of frivolous lawsuits aimed at paralyzing the detention system. As the Deputy Secretary rightly pointed out, the prior administration implemented a number of reforms to strengthen oversight of its detention facilities. Having worked with ICE leadership in the prior administration as those reforms were developed, I am confident that they provide for appropriate treatment of illegal immigrant and criminal alien detainees. We must not forget that most illegal immigrants and criminal aliens hold the keys to their detention cells. They can leave immigration detention simply by accepting their deportation orders and returning to their home country. The difficult reality that the Obama administration faces is that the open borders crowd will never be satisfied as long as illegal immigrants are arrested, detained and deported. Though this administrations enforcement efforts are significantly weaker than those of the prior administration, it has not abandoned enforcement altogether. And so they will continue to be at odds with those who want nothing short of amnesty for lawbreakers.
07.29.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement today after the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee passage of the PASS ID act, which repeals key provisions of the REAL ID Act. Ranking Member Smith: Todays vote to weaken the REAL ID Act will harm national security and endanger American lives. Senators Lieberman and Collins deserve credit for their revisions, which represent moderate improvements to the original bill with regard to security of birth certificates, but their changes simply do not go far enough. America was attacked by foreign nationals who were able to exploit U.S. laws to live unnoticed in the United States. The 9/11 hijackers obtained 17 driver licenses from Arizona, California and Florida and 13 state “issued IDs from Florida, Virginia and Maryland. The hijackers misused federal immigration laws to enter the United States, and once here, obtained the drivers licenses that allowed them to board the aircraft with which they subsequently murdered over 3,000 innocent Americans. It is a shame that some people have such short memories. Rather than undoing REAL ID, we should remember the lessons of 9/11. Congress should take a pass on the PASS ID Act.
07.29.2009	The House Judiciary Committee today approved a bill to reduce sentences for criminals convicted of trafficking crack cocaine. The legislation, H.R. 3245, removes crack cocaine from the federal drug laws, eliminating any distinction between penalties for crack and powder cocaine trafficking offenses. Congress enacted tough penalties for crack cocaine in the 1980s to address the surge in inner city violence and help reduce drug-related offenses. The hefty prison sentences reduced the crack epidemic and Americas streets are safer today as a result. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement opposing the legislation: This bill sends the wrong message to drug dealers and those who traffic in ravaging human lives: It sends the message that Congress does not take drug crimes seriously. Reducing sentences for crack traffickers ignores the violent and devastating crack cocaine epidemic of the past and the horrible effects of crack cocaine on our neighborhoods and communities nationwide. This proposal threatens to return America to the days when crack cocaine decimated a generation and destroyed communities. To eliminate crack cocaine penalties from the federal drug trafficking laws would be to surrender after winning the war%21 The Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Narcotics Officers Association Coalition, and the National District Attorneys Association all oppose eliminating the sentencing ratio between crack and powder cocaine.
07.28.2009	Congressmen Charles Gonzalez, Ciro Rodriguez and Lamar Smith today announced $10,354,400 in federal funding for the City of San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) to hire 50 police officers. The grant from the Department of Justice Office (DOJ) of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Recovery Program (CHRP) will provide the salary and benefits for entry level officer positions for a three-year period. The SAPD will be required to retain the grant-funded positions for a fourth year. Gonzalez, Rodriguez and Smith sent a letter of support to the DOJ to advance the request for funding. The growing needs of San Antonio demand more police protection, said Congressman Gonzalez. We have heard the growing need for additional officers from our Police Chief, Mayor, and City Council and todays funding will help meet their request. Our common goal has been and will always be public safety. Our citizens deserve the very best when it comes to public safety, said Congressman Ciro Rodriguez. This grant money gives our law enforcement agencies the resources they need to hire officers who will patrol our streets, respond to emergencies and protect our residents. With the crime rate in San Antonio rising last year, this funding will enable the SAPD to increase and retain the manpower needed to fight crime more effectively through community policing, said Congressman Smith, who is the Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee. The addition of 50 police officers will have a positive impact on the safety and security of our city. Funding for 50 new officers will bolster our pro-active, crime fighting efforts and support our community-oriented partnerships in San Antonio, said San Antonio Police Chief William McManus. According to the FBIs Preliminary Unified Crime Report, incidents of violent crime in San Antonio increased from 2007 to 2008 from 7,327 to 9,699. Robbery, aggravated assault, property crime, burglary, theft and arson also saw significant increases. The SAPD works closely with residents and the business community to develop programs to reduce crime. The officers hired through this funding will be appointed to both Community Policing Units and the San Antonio Fear Free Environment (SAFFE) program to combat serious violent and property crimes. Officers will have specialized training in community policing and will focus on chronic problems, building community partnerships, and addressing community needs.
07.27.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $350;000 for the New Braunfels Independent School District (NBISD) was included in the FY2010 Labor; Health and Human Services; Education Appropriations bill and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. The federal funding will enable Texas Mathworks to provide NBISD with specialized training for teachers in math education. Texas Mathworks is a center for mathematics education formed by Texas State University System to develop high-level mathematics programs for K-12 students. I support students involvement in mathematics and believe young people should be encouraged to study in the fields of Science; Technology; Engineering and Math (STEM); said Smith; who is a senior member of the House Science and Technology Committee. Texas Mathworks has proven to be an effective model for engaging and retaining students interest in math and science; enabling teachers to effectively teach it at the highest levels. Mathworks will train NBISD teachers to conduct math camps during the summer. During the academic year the teachers will pilot a new curriculum and will support other math related activities; such as math club and parents math nights.
07.24.2009	Congressmen Lamar Smith (TX-21) and John Carter (TX-31) today announced that $19,140,000 in funding for Austin was included in the FY2010 Transportation, HUD Appropriations bill and passed by the House of Representatives. The money will be used to purchase para-transit vehicles for Capital Metro, as well as new technology to improve bus service and traffic congestion. Austin is a world-class city and this federal funding will help to make its transportation system world-class, said Congressman Smith. Whether you rely on Capital Metro or drive a car, this funding will benefit the whole community. These funds are very important in helping Central Texas stay ahead of the population growth we continue to experience, said Congressman Carter. We can't afford to let our public transportation system fall behind. I am especially pleased we were able to include funds that allow the disabled to more easily use the system. ""Central Texans know we live in a congested region,"" said Mayor Lee Leffingwell. ""These federal dollars will help Austin in our fight for better transportation options, less congestion and a smarter traffic system."" $17,390,000 is for Capital MetroRapid enhanced bus service, which will include two initial routes: North Lamar/South Congress and Burnet/South Lamar. Capital MetroRapid will offer better passenger amenities including real-time bus arrival information at all MetroRapid stops, 10-minute frequency during peak and 15 minutes during off-peak service with reduced travel times up to 20 percent. $500,000 was included at the request of Congressman Smith for the City of Austins intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The funding will help the City provide Austin residents and visitors with mobility information related to traffic congestion, transit alternatives, access routes into downtown, and access routes to major events. $1,250,000 was received under the request of Congressman Carter for the Captial Metropolitan Transportation Authority Accessible Fleet Replacement for the purchase of para-transit vehicles. The funding will help Captial Metro replace vans and sedans that serve persons with disabilities.
07.24.2009	Today, the San Antonio Congressional Delegation announced that the San Antonio VIA Metropolitan Transit Authority will receive over $30 million in funding. The funding is provided under the Department of Transportations Federal Transit Administration (FTA) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Representatives Henry Cuellar (TX-28), Charles Gonzalez (TX-20), Ciro Rodriguez (TX-23), and Lamar Smith (TX-21) announced VIA Metropolitan Transit Authority will receive $30,234,746 to purchase buses and additional equipment. This is one more way that the economic recovery bill is creating jobs and strengthening our economy in San Antonio and Bexar County, said Congressman Cuellar. In these challenging economic times, these funds will help strengthen this transportation system and help employees get to work, help families get to the store, and help drive our economy forward. ""I am proud to announce over $30 million in FTA funding for VIA. These transportation investments will yield dividends for our community for years to come, said Rep. Gonzalez. ""The innovative investment in public transportation will help fight traffic congestion, create local jobs, and most importantly, strengthen our economy as a direct result of the public transportation opportunities it provides our residents. The funds will be used to purchase twenty-eight 40 busses and one 35 bus for replacement purposes. The money will also be used to acquire mobile fare collection, support and communication equipment. Fifty three bus stops in the downtown area will also be upgraded with new signs, kiosks, and shelters. ""Funding our public transportation infrastructure is a sound investment in our community,"" said Congressman Rodriguez. ""Providing smart and economical means of transportation will benefit the people of Bexar County and surrounding areas. This is a worthy use of stimulus funds and will significantly enhance the transportation infrastructure of San Antonio, our economy, and overall quality of life, said Congressman Smith. In addition, the Texas Department of Transportation will receive $7,588,110 to be used to rehabilitate/renovate intercity bus facilities, purchase two full-size revenue vans and one 45ft. intercity over-the-road revenue coach.

07.17.2009	Today; the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 3170; the Financial Services Appropriations bill; which included $4 million for a new federal courthouse in San Antonio at the request of Congressmen Charles Gonzalez (TX-20) and Lamar Smith (TX-21). Im proud we were able to secure funding for the new federal courthouse; which will serve the community for years to come; said Rep. Gonzalez. Originally part of the 1968 HemisFair; the current building was never designed as a courthouse. That; coupled with age; clearly requires a new building to accommodate the greater case load of our ever expanding community. The construction of a new courthouse demonstrates a key investment in smart growth planning for our community and will help to jumpstart our economy by creating jobs throughout its construction. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to ensure that this project receives the support it needs. The population of San Antonio has more than doubled since the current facility opened in 1975; said Rep. Smith; who is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. A new courthouse that meets the needs of the Judiciary and our growing community is a prudent use of federal funding. Im glad that Rep. Gonzalez and I were able to win support for this worthy project. The existing John H. Wood; Jr. United States Courthouse was originally constructed as a circular theater for the San Antonio Hemisfair Celebration in 1968 and was renovated in 1975 to serve as the federal courthouse. The inefficient building does not have sufficient space for the court; does not provide adequate security; and has air quality and mold problems. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has identified a site and intends to swap the land the courthouse is currently on; as well as an adjacent government-owned site; for a city-owned property on which to build the courthouse. The funding will enable GSA to hire an architect to design the facility.
07.17.2009	Today; the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 3183; the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act; which included over $3 million for San Antonio area projects. These projects include: $1.5 Million for the San Antonio Channel Improvement Project; $1 Million for the Bexar County Solar Collection Farm and Distribution System; and $600 K for Nueces River and Tributaries Project. Representatives Henry Cuellar (TX-28); Charles Gonzalez (TX-20); Ciro Rodriguez (TX-23); and Lamar Smith (TX-21) worked to have the funds included in the FY 2009 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. Together we worked to secure these dollars to restore a great stretch of San Antonios river channel; said Rep. Cuellar. Anytime we can invest in our natural resources we invest in our communities. And Im proud to work with the delegation in funding these projects which will ultimately benefit the people of San Antonio. San Antonio will gain from these valuable investments for years to come; said Rep. Gonzalez. I am proud that together; the San Antonio delegation was successful in their fight to include these funds in the bill. With this funding; we can make real progress to spur the use and production of clean; efficient energy and help restore the splendor of our communitys natural resources. This funding will pave the way to economic development; while protecting our natural resources and restoring our communitys public lands. Congressman Ciro Rodriguez said the vote demonstrates a commitment to some of the San Antonio's most important projects. ""The San Antonio River is both a symbol of our history and a strong economic generator. Improving it pays tribute to its importance and enhances its economic role;"" Rodriguez said. ""The Nueces River and solar projects; meanwhile; will facilitate the smarter usage of two precious resources: water and the sun."" Economically; culturally and environmentally; the benefits of these projects are numerous; said Rep. Smith. This federal funding will help San Antonio harness a natural resource that we have in abundance “ sunlight “ and protect a natural resource that is so very precious in Texas “ our rivers. San Antonio projects included in the bill: The San Antonio Channel Improvements project will restore an eight-mile stretch of the San Antonio River south of downtown previously channelized for flood control purposes; and provide advances economic development and neighborhood revitalization in a historically underdeveloped and neglected inner-city neighborhood. (As requested by Cuellar; Gonzalez; Rodriguez and Smith) The Nueces River and Tributaries project will provide a detailed study of the complex relationships between surface water; groundwater and the varying ecosystems and communities dependent on such water. The study will represent a holistic approach to addressing ecosystem restoration; flood control; aquifer recharge; water supply; water quality; brush management; and overall watershed resource management. (As requested by Gonzalez; Rodriguez; and Smith) The Solar Collection Farm and Distribution System project involves the installation of a 200-kilowatt solar photovoltaic (PV) system. This system will be integrated into the new 205;000 square feet Justice Center Expansion building. The PV system will convert natural sunlight into electricity to be used by the building. It will generate approximately 10% of the building's total annual electricity usage. (As requested by Gonzalez and Smith)
07.14.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith last week congratulated Senior Chief Lauro A. Garza, Sr., from San Antonio, Texas, for being named the 2009 Navy Times Sailor of the Year. Senior Chief Garza serves as a hero and inspiration to all of us, said Smith. His accomplishments are many and his love for his country is astounding. A Navy Reserve sailor, Garza is preparing to be deployed to Iraq for a third time since Sept. 11, 2001. He is a regular volunteer at Brooke Army Medical Center and an expert bugler who has insisted on playing at veteran funeral services for 17 years at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, National Cemetery. He has served as the live bugler at 150 funerals in the last year alone. I would agree with the Military Times when they said that Chief Garza is ˜someone that lives to serve his country, Smith said. I commend him for his exemplary service and dedication to America. For the past eight years, the Military Times Service Members of the Year honorees have been nominated by their peers, readers of Army Times, Air Force Times, Navy Times, and Marine Corps Times. Honorees are recognized as outstanding individuals for their professionalism, compassion, character and community service at home and overseas.

07.13.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith welcomed Haley Gray; a junior at New Braunfels High School; to Capitol Hill last week to participate in the 2009 U.S. House of Representatives Page Program. Smith sponsored Gray and she is one of 72 students selected from across the nation for the program. We are proud to have Haley representing the 21st District of Texas; said Smith.

07.09.2009	House Republicans today sent a letter to Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine requesting an investigation into whether improper political considerations led to the Departments dismissal of the New Black Panther Party case. According to the Justice Departments complaint, members of the New Black Panther Party engaged in brazen acts of voter intimidation outside a polling place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Election Day 2008. The Justice Department won the case against the New Black Panther Party because the defendants failed to respond to the governments allegations. But rather than obtain a default judgment against the Party to prohibit the defendants from engaging in future voter intimidation tactics, the Justice Department”under the new Democratic leadership”abruptly dropped the case. There were no allegations of prosecutorial misconduct or any changes to the facts underlying the case to justify the dismissal. The Justice Department has refused to respond to Congressional inquiries requesting information regarding the sudden dismissal of the case. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science Ranking Member Frank Wolf (R-Va.) were joined by members of both the Judiciary and Appropriations Committees in requesting the investigation. Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties members who signed the letter include: Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.); Congressman Steve King (R-Iowa); Congressman Trent Franks (R-Ariz.); Congressman Louie Gohmert (R-Texas); and Congressman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). All Republican members of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science joined in signing the letter: Congressman John Culberson (R-Texas); Congressman Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.); and Congressman Jo Bonner (R-Ala.).

07.08.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $700,000 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was included the FY 2010 Energy and Water Appropriations bill at his request and passed by the full Appropriations Committee late last night. The money will be used for the Lower Colorado River Authority study to identify ways to reduce flooding along the North Tributary of the Guadalupe River, including Travis County. Homes, businesses and lives will be protected from potential flood damages as a result of this study, said Smith. This federal funding will enable us to reduce the risk before a disaster occurs. The lower Colorado River basin, also known as flash flood alley has a long history of severe flood events. In 2000, the LCRA along with local communities up and down the basin entered into a partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to begin a basin wide flood reduction and ecosystem restoration study. The purpose of the study is to identify flood prone areas within the lower Colorado River Basin with the goal of developing cost effective solutions for flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration.
07.08.2009	Representatives Lamar Smith (TX-21), Steve King (IA-5), Brian Bilbray (CA-50), Jack Kingston (GA-1), and Sue Myrick (NC-9) commented on todays actions by the Obama administration to address the massive problem of illegal immigrants in the U.S. workforce. Congressman Smith, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee said, The Obama administration deserves credit for finally recognizing that U.S. citizens and legal workers should not have to compete with illegal immigrants for jobs. But it is sad that an administration that claims to want to crack down on employers who hire illegal immigrants has made it harder for companies that follow the law. It is odd. On the one hand, the administration is saying that illegal immigrants should not have federally-funded jobs. On the other hand, they are telling businesses that when illegal immigrants are unmasked in their workforces, there is little the company can do to address it. Congressman King, Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security & International Law, said, The problem of identity theft and social security fraud by illegal immigrants is well-documented, and one protection against such abuses is the No-Match letter. When illegal aliens use stolen or fraudulent identity documents to get jobs, it can trigger a No-Match letter. The Obama administration does a grave disservice to the American people if it does not provide American companies with clear guidance for how to deal illegal immigrants in its workforce after receipt of a No-Match letter. Congressman Bilbray, who Chairs the House Immigration Reform Caucus, said, The number one reason for illegal immigrants to come across our border is to find illegal employment. I am pleased that the Obama Administration has finally embraced the highly effective E-Verify program for government contractors and subcontractors. However, this plan does not go far enough. We need to ensure that every business in America uses the E-Verify program to protect against illegal employment, and to make sure employers do not exploit the labor of illegal workers. Even further, it is a shame that the Obama Administration has decided to take away the No-Match letters that help employers with both legal and illegal employees. Congressman Kingston, who has been a leading voice to support and strengthen E-Verify, said, Todays announcement is a step forward and a step back. The Administration has finally addressed the need for the federal government to lead by example when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws. How they could do this in one step and in another abandon no-match letters is a mystery that defies all. It makes me wonder if the Administration is still playing games or if they are serious about addressing the problem. Congresswoman Myrick, who has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security to bring more immigration enforcement to North Carolina, said, Requiring the use of E-verify is common-sense policy. People who enter the country illegally shouldnt be rewarded with jobs, especially not while unemployment rates continue to rise. Todays actions are as follow: ¢ DHS announced that, after delaying implementation of the federal contractor rule for E-Verify three times, the rule will take effect on September 8. ¢ DHS announced that it will rescind the safe-harbor process for employers to follow should they receive a No-Match letter from the Social Security Administration. o According to the Department of Homeland Security, every year, the Social Security Administration (SSA) informs thousands of employers via a ˜no-match letter that certain employees names and corresponding Social Security numbers provided on Forms W-2 do not match SSAs records every year. In the most recent year for which SSA has data, more than 140,000 employers had sufficient numbers of mismatches to warrant such a letter. Mistakes are often an indication that the employee is an illegal immigrant. o Repealing the rule tells businesses who do not want to follow the law that they can continue to ignore these letters, even though they know that the people listed on them are often illegally in the U.S.
07.06.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $250,000 for the City of Boerne was included the FY 2010 Homeland Security Appropriations bill at his request and approved by the full House. The money will be used to modernize radio equipment to allow for interoperability between various first-responder entities and to equip Boernes planned public safety center for such operations. In order to meet current emergency communications standards and adapt to improving technology, the existing equipment must be upgraded, said Smith. This technology, which is for new the Emergency Operations Center and Emergency 911 Public Safety Answering Point, will serve all of Kendall County, including Boerne and Fair Oaks Ranch. The funding will cover the purchase and installation of the emergency communications equipment, including dispatch consoles, a microwave connection to the Lower Colorado River Authority 900 MHz radio system, and emergency power generators, along with the appropriate computers, security audio/visual equipment for the new facility. ""I'm deeply appreciative to Congressman Smith for his help in securing needed funds to purchase new radio equipment for our Emergency Operations Center. This new equipment will provide state of the art emergency operations for the entire Kendall County area, said Boerne Mayor Dan Heckler. As the City of Boerne and Kendall Country grows, so does our need for the rapid dispatch of emergency vehicles and public notification. I congratulate Congressman Smith for securing the necessary funding through the Homeland Security Appropriation bill so that we can provide for the safety of our citizens."" This federal funding comes at an ideal time, because as the Kendall County community continues to grow, communication and coordination are crucial for fast emergency response times, said City of Boerne Police Chief Gary Miller. On behalf of first responders and the public, we are grateful to Congressman Smith for his support. Construction of the Boerne public safety center is expected to be complete by June 2010.
06.29.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today opposed the Cap and Trade energy bill known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act and said it was really a tax on all Americans. The bill is expected to raise energy costs on American families by as much as $1,600 a year according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, Smith asserted. A new study by the National Black Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) found the legislation would increase the cost of electricity by 45% and the cost of a gallon gas by 60 cents. Smith added, In Europe, cap and trade policies have raised energy prices on consumers and put companies out of business. The decrease in carbon emissions has been negligible. Smith said that for the sake of the environment and the economy Americans need a comprehensive energy plan, not a national energy tax. He supports an alternative called the American Energy Act. The American Energy Act develops more American resources, invests in renewable and alternative energy sources, offers incentives for better efficiency and conservation, and makes a renewed commitment to clean and emissions-free nuclear energy.
06.29.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Courts decision in Ricci v. Destefano. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found that local governments cannot deny an individual a promotion solely based on race. Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor was on the 2nd Circuit Court of appeals panel that found in favor of the local government. Ranking Member Smith: I applaud the Supreme Courts decision to uphold equal rights for all and to strike down government decisions based on race. Unlike the Second Circuits decision where a panel of judges issued a short paragraph affirming the lower courts ruling, the Supreme Courts decision shows a thorough and careful examination of the law. No individual should be denied a promotion simply based on the color of their skin. The Second Circuit wrongly upheld a decision that supports discrimination by the government. The Supreme Court today reminded all courts and governments that equal justice under the law means refusing to tip the scale in favor of one race over another. The Senate Judiciary Committee should carefully examine Judge Sotomayors role in the Second Circuits opinion on this case. Discrimination and racial preferences have no place in our courts, let alone on the highest court in the land.
06.18.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $19.8 million in federal funding for Fort Sam Houston was included in the Military Construction bill passed by the appropriations subcommittee and is expected to be passed by the full Appropriations Committee and sent to the House shortly. $10.8 million is for Fort access control points and road improvements; while $9 million is designated for a general instruction building. American servicemen; women; and their families deserve the finest facilities and support system possible. The contributions of the individuals stationed in San Antonio play a vital role in our nations security; said Smith. The militarys presence here also has a multi-billion dollar impact on the local economy. This funding helps to address all facets. The $10.8 million will renovate the main gate on Fort Sam Houston on Walter Street and link with the TXDOT project to build the new bridge over I-35 and the City of San Antonio project to widen Walter Street. It will provide for a pedestrian gate; a visitor control center and a vehicle inspection area. The $9 million is for an instructional facility designated to be a center for professional training of Morale; Welfare; and Recreation staff for Installation Management Command.
06.17.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith last night opposed the Conference Report on H.R. 2346 “ the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009 because it shifts $5 billion from American troops in order to give the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a global bailout. It narrowly passed with 32 Democrats voting against it. Smith issued the following statement: Its unconscionable that this legislation cuts the House level of funding for our troops and turns around and gives that money to the IMF. Because of this bill, Iran will be eligible to receive $1.8 billion in guaranteed IMF assets even as its government continues to build nuclear weapons. The task here was simple: write a bill to fund our service men and women who are bravely performing the duties overseas. I dont understand why its so difficult for the Democratic Majority to bring forward a clean troop funding bill without wasteful spending and bailouts. The Democratic-controlled Congress already passed the stimulus, which was the biggest spending bill in American history. They passed several bailouts, an enormous omnibus spending bill, as well as the most costly budget in American history. It seems that the Democratic Majority is in favor of increased spending in every way conceivable except when it comes to the critical troop funding for the Department of Defense and Military Construction. They had the opportunity to pass a bill that supports the troops. Instead they passed a global bailout on the backs of the troops.

06.11.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that H.R. 1709, the STEM Education Coordination Act of 2009, which he cosponsored, was passed this week by the House 353 “ 39. The legislation establishs a committee to develop a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education strategic plan and to coordinate federal programs and activities in support of STEM education, including at the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Department of Education. Science and technology are critical to national security, economic strength, and quality health care, said Smith. We must make the necessary investments in basic research and science education to ensure that the United States remains the worlds leader in technology and innovation. That is why I cosponsored this bill. The business and academic communities, Congress, and the Administration have all noted the lagging indicators for American innovation. This bill will help ensure that we at least do a better job of maximizing the effectiveness of current federal dollars being spent on STEM activities. We urge Congress to swiftly move the urgent legislation, said Tom Luce, President and CEO of the National Math and Science Initiative. Smith said that he believes young people should be encouraged to study in the STEM fields. He also supported the America COMPETES Act in the last Congress, which was signed into law and offers incentives for students to pursue careers in math and science and ensures American classrooms are filled with highly qualified teachers. These measures will help to ensure that future generations of Americans are prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st Century, said Smith.
06.10.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced $1.55 million for local law enforcement training and equipment, which was included at his request in the FY2010 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill that was approved by the sub-committee and the full Appropriations Committee. It will now go to the House floor for a vote. $250,000 is designated for the Austin Police Department to purchase surveillance cameras and deploy them in high crimes areas in Austin. $1.3 million is for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) program at Texas State University-San Marcos to train officers from a number of entities, including the Lakeway PD, the Live Oak PD, and the Travis County Sheriff's Office, to respond and deal with active shooter situations. As a concerned Texan and Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, supporting the law enforcement community is one of my highest priorities, said Smith. This federal funding will increase public and officer safety, as well as provide high quality documentation and evidence of police activity. Police cameras have been shown to reduce crime and provide video evidence that bolsters the prosecution of criminal cases. APD will use the cameras to fight all crime, with a focus on potentially life-threatening crimes such as assaults and robberies which have recently increased in various City locations. The Austin Police Department appreciates the support from Congressman Lamar Smith in our work to protect our community, said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. The video technology made possible through this federal funding brings an additional resource that will benefit the people of Austin, helps our officers in their day-to-day law enforcement responsibilities, and ultimately makes our community a safer place. The nationally recognized ALERRT course provides first responding police officers from across the country with the skills to stop the violence committed by homicidal/suicidal subjects, such as active shooters in schools, and domestic and foreign terrorists. Funding for ALERRT will enable the program to train more patrol officers, including our department, and thereby improve the safety of our community, said Lieutenant Todd Radford, who helped spearhead the request. Thank you Congressman Smith for your work on behalf of the Lakeway PD. ALERRT officers make their communities safer through improved response to violent crimes in progress, as well as improved tactical team movements, rescue team tactics, and building search methods, said Don Montague, executive director, ALERRT. Texas State is grateful to Congressman Smith for his support of our effort to make Texas and the nation safer.
06.09.2009	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith today issued the following statement regarding the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainee Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani to New York for prosecution: The Administrations decision to bring Al Qaeda terrorist Ghailani to the U.S. for prosecution sets a dangerous precedent for the more than 200 suspected terrorists currently held at Guantanamo Bay. Ghailani is being charged for his role in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya that killed 224 people. But by bringing Ghailani to the U.S., the Obama Administration is granting a terrorist and murderer additional constitutional rights. Even if convicted, Ghailani could be released in the U.S. after serving his sentence. Before transferring a single Gitmo detainee to the U.S., the Administration has a responsibility to give Congress and the American people the full story. The American people are overwhelmingly opposed to transferring Gitmo detainees to the U.S. Thats why the Obama Administration secretly transferred a known terrorist to the U.S. in the dark of the night without notifying Congress. Despite promises of transparency, the Obama Administration continues to keep the American people in the dark.
06.05.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today officially launched the Congressional Media Fairness Caucus (MFC), along with Congressman Jack Kingston and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who will serve as caucus co-chairs. The purpose of the MFC is not to censor or condemn, but to encourage the media to adhere to the highest standards of reporting and to provide the American people with the facts, balanced stories and fair coverage of the news. If the American people dont get the facts, they cant make good decisions. And if the American people cant make good decisions, then our republic is threatened, said Smith. At their best, the media are an asset to our democratic process. Unfortunately, too often the media have fallen short. Through the Media Fairness Caucus, Members of Congress will utilize their own First Amendment rights to confront media bias and to encourage American citizens to do the same. Through floor statements, op-eds, social networking, and other channels, members of the MFC will work to highlight media bias at the national level, promote an open dialogue between national media and elected officials, and encourage the American people to become engaged and educated consumers of media. Smith cited the following examples of the existence of media bias: ¢ A UCLA study rated 18 of 20 major news outlets as more liberal than the average American voter. Just two scored as more conservative than the average voter. ¢ A Gallup poll found that only 9 percent of Americans say they have a great deal of trust and confidence in the mass media to report the news ""fully, accurately, and fairly."" The Gallup poll also found that more than twice as many Americans say the news media are too liberal rather than too conservative. ¢ A study by the nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affairs found that network news programs gave President Obama more than three times the coverage that they gave former President George W. Bush early in his presidency.VIDEO: Fox News Inteview on the Launch of the Media Fairness Caucus
06.05.2009	Department slated to receive approximately $1.1 Million in funding for technology upgrades to patrol cars U.S. Congressman Ciro D. Rodriguez (TX-23) announced $1.1 million in Appropriations Subcommittee-approved funding for the San Antonio Police Department. Mayor JuliÃ¡n Castro, City Manager Sheryl Sculley and Police Chief William McManus joined Rodriguez on the steps of City Hall in San Antonio at a news conference Friday to make the announcement. The funding request, made jointly with Congressman Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20) and Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), was approved Thursday by the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies. It must now go to the House for a final vote. This funding request is a giant stride toward equipping local law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to protect the community, Congressman Rodriguez said. By helping to fund new technology, I am proud to support those who put their lives on the line to protect and serve. Congressman Gonzalez said The funding in this bill provides the San Antonio Police Department with additional resources to better communicate and respond to citizens in an emergency situation. As this bill advances through the House and onto the Senate, I will continue to advocate for these funds that benefit the people of San Antonio and ensure our first responders are well equipped. Congressman Lamar Smith added: As a concerned resident of San Antonio and the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, supporting the men and women of the law enforcement community is one of my highest priorities. This federal funding will increase officer safety and provide high quality documentation and evidence of police activity.
06.02.2009	In Case You Missed It¦ By David Hendricks Pending cap-and-trade energy legislation in Congress will be too expensive and will not curb carbon emissions enough, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, said Monday during a Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce luncheon. Smith said the Congressional Budget Office estimates a federal cap-and-trade program would cost U.S. families an average of $1,600 in higher energy costs each year. The 22-year veteran congressman said that is the lowest estimate he has seen so far. A cap-and-trade program would set limits for carbon emissions from industrial and commercial sources. Permits for increased usage must be purchased or traded from companies that are reducing emissions. No matter what, it will be expensive, Smith said. It wont reduce emissions, he added, citing limited success in Europe and the lack of similar programs elsewhere in the world. Smith said he supports growth in solar and wind power, especially as ways are developed to store and to transmit alternative electrical generation. But the hard reality is that only 2 percent of power comes from wind and solar, Smith told more than 150 people attending the chamber luncheon. Seventy percent of power still comes from carbon-emitting fossil fuels, Smith said, and 20 percent comes from nuclear power. I think nuclear needs to be part of the mix as we try to reduce our reliance on foreign energy, Smith said. Smith said he also favors opening part of the protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for drilling, stating that oil reserves there could offset 20 percent of the oil imported from Saudi Arabia. On other issues: Smith said momentum has slowed in Congress toward action on proposed legislation that would allow labor unions to organize workers though open balloting. He said polls show 80 percent of U.S. workers believe union membership is an individual decision and believe that secret balloting should continue. Smith called President Barack Obamas budget proposals unsustainable because, for the first time, the U.S. government would spend twice as much as it gets in revenues. This would add to the burden of future generations, the congressman said. Smith said the $1.3 trillion price tag for proposed health care policies is too high. Small businesses would be hit hard, and waits for health care services would lengthen, he said. He also said he believes three-fourths of U.S. citizens would oppose proposed health care reforms if they knew how much it would cost and that there will be government intervention between doctors and patients.
05.22.2009	In Case You Missed It¦ ""GM now stands for Government Motors,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.). ""While the UAW is cashing in, it's the dealers, creditors and American taxpayers who are being forced to cash out."" By David Cho, Peter Whoriskey and Kendra Marr The Obama administration is preparing to send General Motors into bankruptcy as early as the end of next week under a plan that would give the automaker tens of billions of dollars more in public financing as the company seeks to shrink and reemerge as a global competitor, sources familiar with the discussions said. The move comes as the administration prepares to lift the nation's other faltering car company, Chrysler, from bankruptcy protection as soon as next week, industry sources said. The shifts into and out of bankruptcy are landmarks in the Obama administration's attempt to broker a historic restructuring of the American auto industry in the space of months. The legal tactic is viewed by some as the best means of reviving the companies. But the speed of the government-led transformation has triggered complaints that the rights of investors and dealers are being trampled. Meanwhile, fears that a bankruptcy could lead to cascading business failures are spreading throughout GM's vast chain of suppliers. Under the GM draft bankruptcy plan, the company would receive just short of $30 billion in additional federal loans, a source said. The figure is a starting point in negotiations between the government and the company, the source said, and could change. A cash injection that large would boost the U.S. investment in GM to nearly $45 billion. The timing of the filing is also fluid, and could happen the first week of June. The government previously indicated that it planned to take at least 50 percent of the restructured company, and likely would take the right to name members to its board of directors, as it has at Chrysler, where the government will control four of nine seats. The United Auto Workers retiree health fund is set to own as much as 39 percent of the restructured GM, in exchange for giving up its claim to at least $10 billion that the company owes it. Yesterday, the union announced that it reached an agreement with GM that will reduce the company's labor costs. Still unknown is what part the Canadian government might play in the ongoing GM restructuring. GM operates several plants north of the border. The Canadians agreed to invest about $3.5 billion in the Chrysler restructuring and control one of the nine board seats. In the GM negotiations, the Canadians are poised to make a similar investment, but they are seeking assurances that the share of GM production in their country will remain the same. ""China isn't putting up the money, and Mexico isn't putting up the money,"" said Tony Clement, Canada's Minister of Industry. ""But if we're putting up the money, just as the Americans are, then we have the right to protect our production capacity."" Clement added that the Canadian Auto Workers union would have to make more concessions before the government agrees to get involved in the GM rescue. ""We've basically been joined at the hip with U.S. Treasury on our approach with both Chrysler and GM,"" he said. ""We have officials down here in Washington all the time. We basically review the information together. We devise strategy together and execute strategy together."" Both Chrysler and GM have been saddled with too much in debt and labor costs to compete against rivals from Japan and Korea, industry analysts say. To alleviate the financial burdens, the Obama administration has engaged for months in negotiations with the union, dealers and creditors in hopes of reducing automaker costs without having to resort to bankruptcy court. But last month, the administration concluded that the only way to free Chrysler of its debt was to file for Chapter 11, and it is now nearing a similar decision with GM. The chief obstacle to an out-of-court settlement for GM remains: There has been no agreement between the company and the investors who hold $27 billion worth of GM bonds. Under orders from the Obama administration, GM has offered to give the bondholders a 10 percent equity stake in the restructured company in exchange for giving up their bonds. So far, however, the investors have resisted that proposal and if no accord is reached by June 1, GM will follow Chrysler into bankruptcy. The speed with which the Chrysler bankruptcy has proceeded has given the administration more confidence that the best path for GM may be a similar trip, where the claims of disgruntled creditors and dealers can be more easily resolved. In the Chrysler proceedings, the court has yet to stand in the way of plans to create a new company led by Italian carmaker Fiat. Chrysler's existing assets would be sold to the new company and the new entity could be up and running as soon as next week. That's because Chrysler is asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez to waive the customary 10-day waiting period before the order approving the sale becomes effective. The hearing on the sale is scheduled for next Wednesday at 10 a.m. Gonzalez has already granted a similar request to expedite proceedings. Time and again in court, Chrysler executives and attorneys have argued -- and the court has agreed -- that Chrysler's core assets are ""wasting"" and that an immediate sale must take place to preserve value. ""Subject to the closing conditions, a new Chrysler could emerge as soon as the ink is dry on the judge's order,"" said Scott Van Meter, managing director of LECG, a consulting firm. The administration is taking steps to prepare. It is drafting the paperwork for a $4.7 billion loan to sustain Chrysler after it emerges from bankruptcy. On Wednesday, the automaker announced that C. Robert Kidder, former chairman of Borden Chemical and of Duracell International will become the company's new chairman. He will succeed Robert L. Nardelli. Chrysler still could encounter some delays. The company faces a new legal challenge from pension funds representing Indiana teachers and police officers as well as a state construction fund. The investors, who contend that the automaker's sale violates their rights as senior secured lenders to Chrysler, are seeking to move the bankruptcy proceedings to federal district court, which has authority over the bankruptcy court. A hearing on the matter is scheduled in district court Tuesday. There are also challenges outside court. Chrysler has moved to close 789 dealerships on June 9. But Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) has introduced legislation that would withhold federal funding if the automaker does not give dealers an extra 60 days to close down operations and sell remaining inventory. Her amendment has won the backing of a number of other senators. Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) said he hopes to meet with White House officials today to discuss changing Chrysler's bankruptcy plan and GM's future. Conyers did not outline what he wanted, but a nine-person panel he assembled for a hearing yesterday offered a hint. Liberal consumer advocate Ralph Nader, a conservative Heritage Foundation analyst and minority auto dealers all criticized the automakers' restructuring. Conyers and other committee members attacked the administration for abusing bankruptcy laws, unfairly eliminating dealerships and jeopardizing consumer safety. ""GM now stands for Government Motors,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.). ""While the UAW is cashing in, it's the dealers, creditors and American taxpayers who are being forced to cash out.""

05.21.2009	By Carrie Johnson and Walter Pincus Thursday, May 21, 2009 In news conferences, speeches and debates this week, lawmakers from both parties, as well as the director of the FBI, have sounded alarms about placing detainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in U.S. federal prisons, where they could launch riots, hatch radical plots or somehow be released among the populace. ""No good purpose is served by allowing known terrorists, who trained at terrorist training camps, to come to the U.S. to live among us,"" Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) said. ""Terrorists were detained there for a reason -- to keep Americans safe%21"" ""Part of what we don't want is them be put in prisons in the United States,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday, before saying he was open to changing his position. ""We don't want them around the United States."" In his speech today, President Obama addressed that argument, assuring the public ""we are not going to release anyone"" if it would endanger national security or the public, and pointing out that the nation's prisons already hold convicted terrorists. ""Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal 'supermax' prisons,"" he said. In fact, 23 convicted terrorists with ties to al-Qaeda -- including the architect of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and a conspirator in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon -- reside in a single federal prison in Florence, Colo., with little public notice. For many of the most serious terrorists and violent criminals, Justice Department and prison officials impose special administrative measures, which include sharply curtailing lists of approved visitors and closely monitoring mail. The inmates also are kept in solitary confinement and allowed few contacts with detainees inside their facility and even fewer outside sources of information. The provisions, which require consultation with the FBI or other law enforcement agents, applied to 46 inmates as of February, according to Justice Department statistics. Thirty of those inmates are incarcerated on terrorism-related charges, with the remainder locked up because of involvement with gangs, organized crime or espionage, a department spokesman said. Detained in the supermax facility in Colorado are Ramzi Yousef, who headed the group that carried out the first bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993 and had earlier plotted to bring down several airliners over the Pacific; Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted of conspiring in the terrorist attacks of Sept, 11, 2001, Ahmed Ressam, of the 2000 Los Angeles airport millennium attack plots; Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, conspirator in several plots, including one to assassinate U.S. President George W. Bush; and Wadih el-Hage, convicted of the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. Inmates in Florence, and those incarcerated in the maximum-security, Defense Department-operated disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., rarely see other prisoners. At Leavenworth, the toughest prisoners are allowed outside their cells only one hour a day when they are moved with their legs shackled and accompanied by three guards. ""We have a vast amount of experience in how to judge the continued incarceration of highly dangerous prisoners, since we do this with thousands of prisoners every month, all over the United States, including some really quite dangerous people,"" Philip Zelikow, the University of Virginia professor who was counselor to Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and executive director of the 9/11 commission, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. One detainee who was moved to a prison after being kept in a military brig for years has expressed frustration with the more restrictive conditions in prison. Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a Qatari national who spent nearly six years in a U.S. naval brig in South Carolina, won privileges there, including access to a flat-screen television, newspaper crossword puzzles and chats with his guards, according to his attorneys and an account in the New Yorker magazine. Once U.S. Marshals transported him to a regular prison near Peoria, Ill., to face conspiracy charges, Marri's access to the outside world was limited, his attorneys said. They are seeking to have Marri sent to Qatar to serve the bulk of his term for a single count of conspiracy to support terrorism, rather than enduring a maximum-security American facility. There are a number of detention facilities in Guantanamo where detainees are housed by the military according to their perceived risk. Camp 4 is a minimum-security facility with communal living for about 20 percent of the 240 detainees who the authorities have determined are ""compliant."" The prisoners can wander in and out of dorm-style rooms and hang around benches in a yard together. There are classes in art and English and some access to television, mostly documentaries. Camp Iguana is another minimum-security facility for 20 detainees who have been ordered released by the federal courts. This facility includes the 17 Chinese Uighurs, and some of these prisoners as well as are taking classes and maintain their own vegetable garden at the facility. Camps 5 and 6 are maximum-security facilities that are exact replicas of prisons in Terre Haute, Ind., and Lenawee, Mich. There are approximately 150 prisoners divided between the two facilities, which stand side-by side on the island. In both camps, prisoners are in 22-hour lockdown and have recreation privileges in small cages. Guards wear clear plastic face masks to guard against the urine and feces that some inmates hurl through slots in the steel doors. The authorities say that prisoners can be transferred to Camp 4 if they demonstrate ""good behavior."" One detainee leads the prayers in each tier, and visitors can hear the call to prayer echo through the complex five times a day. The current political debate does not differentiate among the detainees. For example, both federal courts and the Bush administration have determined that the Uighurs are not enemy combatants and that they should be released. Finding a home for them, however, has proved to be a challenge. When the Financial Times reported Wednesday the possibility of two of them being released into the United States, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) objected. ""The detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility are terrorists. We should not let this administration, or anyone else, threaten our national security by releasing them into the United States,"" Shelby said. ""If this is even being considered, the decision to release these terrorists into our country is both reckless and clearly contrary to the will of the American people."" Even some Obama administration officials appeared to be at odds with the president's plan for relocating the 240 remaining detainees in Cuba. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III told the House Judiciary Committee yesterday about his ""concerns about providing financing to terrorists, radicalizing others with regard to violent extremism, the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the United States."" Following up, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) asked, ""Does their presence in our maximum-security prisons present any danger to the United States%3f"" Mueller replied, ""If it's Florence or something, I think it would be very difficult for the person to get out and very difficult for the person to undertake any activity. However . . . there are individuals in our prisons today, as I think you and others are familiar, who operate their gangs from inside the walls of prison."" Later in the day, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. reaffirmed to reporters that a government task force closing down the Guantanamo facility would take no action to put the American people at risk. ""The concerns that have been expressed by the %5bFBI%5d director, concerns expressed by other people, will all be taken into account,"" Holder said. One economically hard-pressed community in Montana is bucking the consensus of ""not in my back yard."" Some residents in Hardin, in the south central part of the state, are volunteering to open the doors of their unused, 464-bed Two Rivers Prison to the Guantanamo detainees. The City Council recently passed a resolution in support. But Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) put his foot down. ""We're not going to bring al-Qaeda to Big Sky Country -- no way, not on my watch,"" he told Time magazine this month. Staff writer Peter Finn and researchers Alice Crites, Madonna Lebling and Julie Tate contributed to this report.
05.21.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith issued the following statement responding to President Obamas comments today regarding the Administrations plan to close Guantanamo Bay. Once again, the Presidents speech was heavy on rhetoric and out of touch with reality. Just one day after the FBI Director said suspected terrorists on U.S. soil pose a threat to Americans, four would-be terrorists were arrested in NYC, and a report found that 74 previously released terrorists have returned to the battlefield, President Obama is still calling for Guantanamo Bay to be closed%21 The Administration asserts that transferring terrorists from a detention facility on an isolated island to a prison inside the U.S. will make Americans safer. The Administrations claims are completely contrary to common sense. By the Presidents logic, we should close all other jails and prisons, too. The President is dodging the main issue: when detainees are sent to American shores, liberal federal judges will give them additional constitutional rights that may result in their release into our communities. And, as the FBI Director testified yesterday, even in U.S. prisons, terrorists can direct terrorist operations. Thats why we want them isolated at Gitmo. Americans and others around the world are safer today because terrorists are kept at Guantanamo Bay. The President should put Americans safety ahead of an image problem he himself created by making a campaign promise to close Gitmo.

05.20.2009	In Case You Missed It¦ ""No good purpose is served by allowing known terrorists, who trained at terrorist training camps, to come to the U.S. and live among us,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the senior Republican on the committee. ""Guantanamo Bay was never meant to be an Ellis Island."" By DEVLIN BARRETT Associated Press Writer FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress on Wednesday that bringing Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States would pose a number of possible risks, even if the they were kept in maximum-security prisons. During his appearance Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee, Mueller was asked what concerns the FBI has about the prospect of transferring to the United States some of the 240 inmates currently held at the naval base in Cuba. President Barack Obama has ordered the Guantanamo Bay detention center closed by January 2010, but that timetable may be in jeopardy. Congress is seeking to block any funding for bringing any detainees to the U.S., whether freed or imprisoned. At the start of Wednesday's hearing, Mueller was asked what concerns the FBI has about the release of Guantanamo detainees. ""The concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the United States run from concerns about providing financing, radicalizing others,"" Mueller said, as well as ""the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the United States."" ""All of those are relevant concerns,"" Mueller said. The FBI chief said he would not discuss specific individuals. He said there were also potential risks to putting detainees in maximum security prisons. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose district includes the World Trade Center site, then prodded Mueller to agree that such individuals could be safely kept in maximum security prisons in the U.S. Mueller balked at Nadler's suggestion, noting that in some instances imprisoned gang leaders have run their gangs from inside prisons. ""It depends on the circumstances,"" Mueller said. Republicans have been attacking Obama on the issue, and even fellow Democrats say they need to see a plan for closing Guantanamo before they can support the White House on it. Republicans urged Mueller to take the FBI's concerns to the White House. ""No good purpose is served by allowing known terrorists, who trained at terrorist training camps, to come to the U.S. and live among us,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the senior Republican on the committee. ""Guantanamo Bay was never meant to be an Ellis Island."" © 2009 The Associated Press

The bill appropriates $81.3 billion for the ongoing war and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and $15.4 billion for military construction, foreign assistance, flu pandemic preparedness and other items. This bill provides essential support to our service men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan who every day make sacrifices on our nations behalf,"" said Smith. ""This bipartisan legislation will also enhance our military infrastructure in Texas, including a warrior in transition complex at Fort Sam and a child development center at Fort Bliss, to better serve our returning troops and their families. This bill is important to our troops because it rightfully compensates those who continue serving past their commitments to service as well as provides for $108 million in military construction at Fort Sam Houston and Fort Bliss, two military bases important to my constituents, our military and our state economy, said Rodriguez. Additionally, this bill includes $470 million for continued work to stem violence along the Mexican Border. Next week, the House may consider a conference report to H.R. 2346 which, if passed, would send the bill to the White House for the Presidents signature.
05.12.2009	By MICHAEL GRACZYK HOUSTON (AP) ” A disgraced federal judge was sentenced Monday to nearly three years in prison for lying to investigators about sexually abusing two female employees, who said they feared him so much they hid from him in the courthouse. U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent stared at the floor while the women described years of harassment and abuse at the Galveston courthouse where he wielded great authority as the only federal judge. He apologized to his wife, his family and the federal court staff but never specifically referred to the two women. He could have received up to 20 years in prison, but prosecutors said they wouldn't seek more than three years under a plea agreement. He also was fined $1,000 and ordered to pay $6,550 in restitution to the secretary and case manager whose complaints resulted in the first sex abuse case ever against a sitting federal judge. ""Your wrongful conduct is a huge black X, a smear on the legal profession, a stain on the judicial system itself, a matter of concern in the federal courts,"" said U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson, a visiting senior judge called in from Pensacola, Fla. Vinson ordered Kent, 59, to surrender June 15 for transfer to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and to serve three years' probation once his 33-month sentence is completed. He also was ordered to participate in an alcohol-abuse program while in prison. The chairman of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee and its ranking Republican demanded that Kent resign immediately from the bench Monday. His lawyer has said he retired rather than resigned, which would allow him to continue drawing a federal judge's salary. ""Unless Judge Samuel Kent immediately resigns, we intend to introduce a resolution jointly tomorrow to commence an inquiry into whether grounds exist to impeach him and remove him from office,"" Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a statement Monday. The women Kent abused told Vinson that they came to work scared Kent might find them, and even neglected to answer courthouse phones to avoid him. Cathy McBroom, Kent's former case manager, said he ""bragged"" about his ability to intimidate people. ""He told me everyone was afraid of him."" McBroom's complaint began the case, which expanded when allegations from the judge's secretary Donna Wilkerson were added. McBroom said making the complaint had been ""incredibly stressful"" and led to the breakup of her marriage and the loss of her home. She said it forced her to give up what she considered her dream job and put her entire life under a public and legal microscope. ""One would think I was the criminal,"" said McBroom, 50. Wilkerson told of seven years of abuse by Kent and said he tried to molest her on her fifth day on the job. Responding to defense allegations that she had been a willing partner in a romantic affair, she said, ""Being molested and groped by a drunken giant is not my idea of an affair."" Kent, speaking softly as he stood before Vinson, described himself as ""completely broken"" and ""in some ways a better person for that."" Kent pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in February as jury selection was about to begin for his trial on the obstruction charge and five sex-crime charges. Conviction on the most serious of those charges could have sent him to prison for life. The five other charges were dismissed Monday. As part of the plea agreement, Kent admitted the sexual contact was against the women's will. Kent's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, said the judge had recently been hospitalized for stress-related illnesses and described the judge as an alcoholic. Kent said he had the ""benefit of 26 months of absolute sobriety."" ""I've come to see the world as the flawed, selfish, indulgent person I have been,"" he said. DeGuerin has said the judge was retiring due to a disability ” which is the only way a judge Kent's age could leave the bench and keep his $169,300-a-year salary. Retired federal judges collect their full salaries for the remainder of their lives; judges who resign get nothing. A council of judges from the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit investigated Kent and suspended him in September 2007 for four months with pay but didn't detail the allegations against him. McBroom had accused Kent of harassing and sexually abusing her over a four-year period, culminating in March 2007, when she said the judge pulled up her blouse and bra and tried to escalate contact until they were interrupted. The judicial panel transferred him from Galveston, where he'd worked since his 1990 appointment, to Houston, 50 miles northwest. After a Justice Department investigation, he was indicted in August; additional charges stemming from Wilkerson's claims were filed against him in January. Copyright © 2009 The Associated Press.

05.09.2009	In response to planned weekend events regarding the impact of immigration enforcement on families, Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement: Ranking Member Smith: When pro-amnesty groups use Mothers Day to talk about the impact of immigration enforcement on families, they ignore the impact of failing to enforce our immigration laws on families. Every day, citizens and legal immigrant families suffer the consequences of crimes by illegal immigrants. We should remember the forgotten victims “ the mothers, families and friends “ of those victimized by criminal illegal immigrants. In fact, more than 15% of federal inmates are criminal aliens, and hundreds of thousands are in state jails for crimes like murder, assault, gang activity and drug charges. We need to enforce all of our immigration laws to prevent these crimes from happening. That means enforcing our worksite laws against employers and illegal workers, supporting local law enforcement agencies who want to arrest illegal immigrants, and passing a long term reauthorization of E-Verify, the federal governments program that helps employers hire legal workers. When amnesty advocates talk about separating families, they should remember families can stay united if children travel to their parents home countries with them. Also, many illegal immigrants come to the U.S. alone, leaving families behind in their native countries. If they wanted their family to be with them, they could return home. Illegal immigrants knowingly broke our laws and entered our country illegally. They need to take responsibility for their actions, not blame others for the situation they caused.""
04.30.2009	H1N1 Flu (Swine Flu) is a serious issue. Be reasonably cautious, but there is no need to panic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Texas Department of State Health Services are monitoring the situation and have a lot of good information on their websites to help answer questions you may have. The websites are:www.cdc.gov/swinefluwww.dshs.state.tx.us/swineflu The State of Texas disaster declaration allows the state to implement emergency protective measures and seek reimbursement under the federal Stafford Act for protective measures associated with the states response to this public health concern.
04.29.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to Attorney General Holders announcement in Germany that 30 Gitmo detainees have been cleared for release or transfer. Ranking Member Smith: Im disappointed that the Administration decided to announce that it has cleared 30 Gitmo detainees for release without first consulting with the U.S. Congress. Nearly three months ago, I asked Attorney General Holder to brief Congress on the Administrations plan to close Guantanamo Bay. I have received no response from the Administration. Based off todays announcement, it appears that my request has been ignored. Releasing terrorists endangers American lives both here and abroad. The American people have a right to know how these decisions are being made; yet this Administration is sharing more information with foreign countries at overseas press conferences than with U.S. Members of Congress elected to represent the American people. The Obama Administration has to accept full responsibility for any additional crimes or terrorist attacks these detainees commit once they are released. Its ironic that the supposed ˜most transparent administration is providing information to foreign nations, while the American people are left in the dark.
04.29.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today released the following statement on President Obamas first 100 days in office: President Obama has been very busy during his first 100 days in office. Unfortunately, his most defining achievements have been putting American lives at greater risk and undermining American workers. Release of OLC Memos Gives Terrorists an Interrogation Cheat-Sheet By releasing OLC interrogation memos in an effort to attack former Bush administration officials, President Obama has placed politics above national security. Terrorists now have a ˜cheat-sheet for how far Americans can legally go with interrogations. According to the CIA, the use of these interrogation techniques helped prevent a 9-11 style attack on Los Angeles, possibly saving American lives. Now Democrats want to punish the authors of a memo that helped thwart a terrorist attack. Punishing government lawyers for providing advice and counsel that saved American lives is a dangerous policy that undermines national security. Closing Guantanamo Bay and Releasing Gitmo Detainees into the U.S. Additionally, in the first 100 days, President Obama announced that he plans to close Guantanamo Bay without giving the American people a safe alternative. According to reports, many of these dangerous terrorists may be transferred to or released inside the U.S. The Obama Administration cannot guarantee that these terrorists will not target American citizens. The terrorists at Gitmo have been held there because they pose a real and dangerous threat to Americans both at home and abroad. Closing Gitmo was a campaign promise, but protecting Americans is the Presidents job. We gain nothing by putting international image-building before American public safety. Putting Illegal Immigrants Ahead of U.S. and Legal Immigrant Workers The President has also defined his first 100 days by stonewalling efforts to ensure American jobs go to American workers. By delaying a rule requiring federal contractors to use E-Verify, discouraging worksite enforcement and announcing a plan to push for amnesty, the Obama administration has effectively said that they dont care if illegal immigrants take jobs from U.S. citizens and legal immigrant workers. The American people should not have to compete with illegal immigrants for scarce jobs, especially during these difficult economic times. The Obama administration has developed a habit of not enforcing the nations immigration laws and placing illegal immigrants above U.S. citizen and legal immigrant workers. If this continues, I am concerned about what the future holds for American workers.
04.24.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today strongly criticized reports that the Obama Administration plans to release as many as seven Gitmo detainees into U.S. communities, calling the move a threat to the safety and security of all Americans. The report cites current U.S. officials and says that several Chinese Muslim terrorists (Uighurs) will be released into American communities to live freely with little supervision. Many of the Uighur detainees have openly admitted ties to U.S.-designated terrorist Abdul Haq, the leader of the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Party. The ETIP is an Al Qaeda affiliated terrorist group. Ranking Member Smith was outraged by the reports and said, These individuals are dangerous terrorists, who trained with extremists in Afghanistan and plotted attacks in China. The Obama administration cannot guarantee that these terrorists will not target American citizens, especially those of Chinese decent. Even the Department of Homeland Security has expressed concern regarding the plan. Before releasing a single terrorist into the United States, the Obama administration must make the Departments concerns public and allow Congress to review the plan. According to media reports, the Uighurs showed extremist behavior when watching a soccer game on television at Guantanamo Bay. The report cites officials claiming that when a woman with bare arms was shown on the screen, one of the group grabbed the television and threw it to the ground. Many of the Uighurs detained at Guantanamo Bay also participated in a riot in which they threw body fluids and feces on guards. Ranking Member Smith continued, The Obama administration is putting the lives of Americans in danger for purely political reasons. Closing Gitmo was a campaign promise, but protecting Americans is the Presidents job. We gain nothing by putting international image-building before American public safety.
04.15.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today, on Tax Day, sent the following letter of support to TEA Party organizers and participants throughout TX-21, which will be read at several TEA Parties in the district. Americans in Texas and across the country today are exercising their Constitutional rights to protest the massive expansion in the size and scope of government currently underway. April 15, 2009 Dear Tax Reducers, Congratulations on a successful TEA Party. If I were in town, I would certainly join you in protesting the unnecessary and punitive tax hikes by the Obama Administration. I did not vote for President Obamas budget because it would increase taxes by $1 trillion and double our national debt in five years, burdening future generations. The budget also proposes an energy tax that, according to the Congressional budget Office, would cost every American household $1,600. The Obama Administrations tax policies aim at punishing the successful, especially small business owners, and redistributing the income earned by hard-working Americans. President Obama also wants to raise the capital gains tax, which will smother job creation. Lets remind the Obama Administration and Congressional leaders that their tax and spend scheme threatens our nations prosperity and our own individual freedoms. Taxation without justification is an obamanation%21 Sincerely, Lamar Smith Member of Congress
04.14.2009	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued a statement criticizing the Administration for its recent report regarding rightwing extremists. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report broadly describes American citizens “ including returning war veterans “ who are concerned about the economic crisis, the scope of the federal government, or issues such as abortion and immigration enforcement, as either rightwing extremists or susceptible to recruitment by extremists. Entitled Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment, the report was sent to law enforcement departments across the nation on April 7. Ranking Member Smith”also a member of the House Homeland Security Committee”issued the following statement: What exactly is the purpose of this report%3f DHS offers no specific data or evidence to back up its claim that ˜rightwing extremism is ˜resurgent. As far as I can tell, the only thing this report does do is attempt to stigmatize people who disagree with the President. For an administration that uses word-games to downplay the threat of foreign terrorists, and regularly accuses others of promoting the ˜politics of fear, theyre awfully willing to paint law-abiding Americans, including war veterans, as ˜extremists.
04.09.2009	Responding to a report in todays New York Times that President Obama intends to pursue an immigration bill this fall, including a path to legalization for illegal immigrants, Ranking Member Lamar Smith (TX-21) issued the following statement: President Obama's approach appears to be nearly identical to the amnesty proposals that the American people roundly rejected just two years ago. The American people will need to stand up again to voice opposition to any proposal that grants amnesty to 12 million illegal immigrants, including seven million who hold jobs rightfully belonging to out-of-work citizens and legal immigrants. What kind of message is President Obama trying to send to jobless auto workers in Detroit, to construction workers in the West or to college students across America looking for their first jobs%3f The hard truth is that any proposal to legalize seven million illegal workers and another five million illegal immigrants legitimizes their illegal actions. No nation should force its citizens and legal workers to compete with illegal immigrants who will be allowed to stay and work. American families, including citizens and legal immigrants, must come first. Americans should call their elected representatives to voice their opposition to this or any form of amnesty.
04.02.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today strongly opposed the Democrats budget, H. Con. Res. 85, which he said spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much at the expense of our nations future. The numbers are staggering. The audacity is astonishing. It amounts to a major assault on the uniquely American principles that have made our country exceptional, said Smith. Under the Democrats budget, the national debt will double in five years and triple in 10. Federal spending in 2010 will exceed $3 trillion and includes more than $1 trillion in tax increases. With their budget, President Obama and Congressional Democrats will create more debt than the previous 43 Presidents did in the last 220 years. When the Presidents of France and China criticize the U.S. for spending too much, you know were in trouble, said Smith. The budget rams through, without debate, several of President Obamas controversial policy initiatives, including: ¢ Government-run health care programs that will restrict individual health care decisions and eliminate private insurance. ¢ Cap-and-trade carbon taxes that will drastically raise energy costs on all Americans. ¢ Elimination of the successful Federal Family Education Loan Program. Of particular concern, especially during an economic crisis, is the cap and trade carbon tax, which, according to the CBO, will cost the average American household an extra $1,600 per year. And the National Association of Manufacturers says that more than one million jobs could be lost by 2012 if cap and trade is implemented. Instead of out-of-control spending, Smith supports the Republican alternative budget, which is designed to curb spending, create jobs, and control the debt. The Republican budget: ¢ Borrows $3.6 trillion less than the President's budget. ¢ Would create $23,000 less debt per household than the President's budget. ¢ Keeps federal spending just above 20 percent of GDP “ the same level as before the recession. ¢ Avoids all tax increases and even simplifies the overly complex tax code. ¢ Includes a temporary moratorium on earmarks. ¢ Begins reforming the unsustainable costs of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

03.25.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today rebuked the Obama administration for instructing its officials to replace use of the term Global War on Terror with Overseas Contingency Operation. According to recent news reports, Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano has started referring to terrorist attacks as man-caused disasters. And earlier this month, the Administration abandoned the use of enemy combatants when referring to Guantanamo Bay detainees. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement in response to the Administrations new rhetoric: While the Obama Administration is busy playing word games, the world remains vulnerable to terrorism. Changing definitions doesnt reduce the threat to national security. Why stop with ˜Overseas Contingency Operation%3f Why not call the Mexican drug cartels ˜recreational pharmacists%3f We can start referring to North Korea as a ˜gated community. Or how about calling terrorist training camps ˜desert day spas%3f Its almost as ridiculous as Iran calling its drive for a nuclear weapon a ˜civilian energy project. This unfortunately is another example of this Administration choosing image over substance.
03.24.2009	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today supported the Administrations efforts to address border violence, but expressed concern about the specifics of the plan. Ranking Member Smith: While I support the administrations plan to increase resources and personnel along the border, I am concerned that the redeployment may come at the expense of other critical law enforcement activities. The administration appears to be using border violence as an excuse to reduce interior enforcement of our immigration laws and enact gun restrictions. With hundreds of federal law enforcement officers being relocated to the border, we must ensure that we do not undercut our national security and immigration enforcement responsibilities.
03.18.2009	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Representatives Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Steve King (R-IA), Howard Coble (R-NC), Trent Franks (R-AZ), James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), Ted Poe (R-TX), Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Ken Calvert (R-CA), Jack Kingston (R-GA), Brian Bilbray (R-CA), John Carter (R-TX), Sue Myrick (R-NC), Patrick McHenry (R-NC), Lynn Westmoreland (R-GA), Henry Brown (R-SC), Donald Manzullo (R-IL), John Culberson (R-TX), K. Michael Conaway (R-TX), Phil Gingrey (R-GA), Paul Broun (R-GA), Dan Burton (R-IN), and Gregg Harper (R-MS) today sent a letter to Thomas Donohue, President and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce regarding the Chambers opposition to the federal governments E-Verify program. Such opposition is in conflict with the Chambers stated desire to help businesses and American workers. Ranking Member Smith: More than twelve and a half million U.S. citizens and legal immigrant workers are looking for work. And there seven million illegal immigrants working in the U.S., according to the most recent Pew estimates. But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes a tool to ensure that jobs are given to American workers. The Chambers opposition to the E-Verify program is surprising given its laudable interest in protecting the jobs of American workers, which E-Verify is designed to do. Illegal immigrants bring down the standard of living for low-skilled American workers and actually reduce wages for native-born workers. If the Chamber is honest in its mission to support U.S. workers, it would support E-Verify. The letter was also sent to the 50 largest local Chambers of Commerce as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerces Committee of 100 (C100). According to the U.S. Chambers website, C100 members recommend Chamber policy on association-related issues. The list of C100 is posted at: https://www.uschamber.com/associations/c100/members.htm ABOUT E-VERIFY E-Verify is the federal governments system that enables companies to hire legal workers by verifying the Social Security numbers provided by newly hired employees. It is currently used by more than 115,000 businesses. E-Verify immediately confirms 99.6% of work-eligible employees, and the National Federation for Independent Business has supported legislation to make it mandatory. LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND In the 110th Congress, the House passed a long term extension of E-Verify by an overwhelming 407-2 bipartisan vote. In the 111th Congress, the House version of the stimulus included a multi-year extension of the program, as well as new provisions requiring any business that receives funding from the stimulus program to utilize E-Verify. In the Senate, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) attempted to offer the House-passed E-Verify provisions as an amendment to the Senate bill, but had every attempt blocked by the Democratic Leadership. As a result, the Senate version of the stimulus did not include any E-Verify provisions. Likewise, E-Verify provisions were not included in the Conference Report. More recently in the 111th Congress, during Senate debate on the Omnibus spending bill, Senator Jeff Sessions introduced an amendment that would have reauthorized E-Verify for the long term. Senate Democrats blocked the long-term worker protections with a roll call vote to table Sessions amendment. The roll call votes are posted online at: https://tinyurl.com/dysxs4. %5bNote: A YEA vote is a vote to table the motion, not allowing Sessions amendment to be considered. A NO vote is a vote to allow consideration of Sessions amendment.%5d
03.12.2009	House Republicans today introduced legislation to reauthorize key national security provisions that are set to expire in 2009. Following the attacks of September 11, the USA PATRIOT Act was enacted to help federal law enforcement and intelligence officials address the new terrorist threat. In 2006, after nearly two years of congressional debate, all but two provisions of the PATRIOT Act and one provision of the Intelligence Reform Act were reauthorized and made permanent. The Safe and Secure America Act of 2009 extends the three expiring provisions for 10 years. Ranking Member Smith: If theres one thing we can predict about terrorism its that its unpredictable. Thats why law enforcement and intelligence officials must remain vigilant. The national security provisions were seeking to reauthorize are proven and effective. They have helped investigators track down terrorists and prevent attacks. Critics of these provisions claim that the terrorist threat has diminished since 2001. But such claims ignore the deadly attacks in London, Madrid, Mumbai and Yemen. If we want to keep Americans”both here and abroad”safe and secure from future terrorist attacks, we need to extend these provisions. Specifically, the Act extends the roving wiretaps provision of the PATRIOT Act, the so-called library provision (aka FISA business records) of the PATRIOT Act and the lone wolf provision of the Intelligence Reform Act. Bill cosponsors include: Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.); GOP Conference Chairman Mike Pence (R-Ind.); House Judiciary Committee Members: Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.); Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.); Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.); Rep. Daniel Lungren (R-Calif.); Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa); Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.); Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio); Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.); and Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.). Additional Republican cosponsors include: Rep. John Sullivan (R-Okla.); Rep. John Shadegg (R-Ariz.); Rep. Duncan Hunter (Calif.); Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn.); and Rep. Mary Fallin (R-Okla.).
03.12.2009	Today Congressmen Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the Republican High Technology Working Group (HTWG), Lamar Smith, Vice Chairman of the HTWG, and Howard P. Buck McKeon, a member of the HTWG and the Ranking Member of the Education and Labor Committee, announced their opposition to the ˜Employee Free Choice Act, legislation that strikes a huge blow to the privacy rights of workers throughout the country. This legislation would effectively eliminate secret ballots in workplace organizing elections. A secret ballot protects voters from being intimidated or bullied and ensures political freedoms that are the foundation of democracy, said Rep. Smith. That the deceptively-named ˜Employee Free Choice Act would seek to deny American workers this basic right, especially at a time of economic turmoil, is unconscionable. It puts the agenda of special interests ahead of job creation and economic growth, which is why the High Tech Working Group and I stand in strong opposition to this misguided legislation. Under current law, employees can petition or sign union authorization cards, commonly referred to as card checks, requesting union representation. If at least 30 percent of employees have signed the petition or cards, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) conducts a private-ballot election to determine if union representation is desired by the majority of the employees. The Employee Free Choice Act would give the NLRB the authority to forgo the secret ballot election when a majority of the bargaining unit employees have signed authorizations designating the union and there is no other union currently recognized as the exclusive representative of any of the employees. These card checks are not private and can be made known to unions, employers, or others. When choosing whether or not to join a union, employees must have the right to cast a private ballot. They should not face fear of intimidation by union bosses and organizers or by employers. Secret ballots are a hallmark of a free and democratic society and are strongly supported by the overwhelming majority of our citizens including union members, said Rep. Goodlatte. I along with the members of the High Tech Working Group remain committed to working to protect this most basic of freedoms for all American workers. Goodlatte continued, American tech companies already face significant, artificial hurdles to competing in the global marketplace, including excessive government red tape and litigation abuses. The High Tech Working Group is dedicated to educating Members about and reducing these hurdles. Unfortunately, the Card Check legislation goes in the complete opposite direction and creates yet another hurdle that will stifle innovation in, and the competitiveness of, the U.S. tech industry. In a recent nationwide survey, conducted by McLaughlin & Associates, 86 percent of individuals surveyed believe that when deciding whether to organize a union a workers vote should remain private with only 8 percent believing that vote should be public information. In these uncertain economic times, Congress should be focused on strategies that will spur innovation and job creation. Unfortunately, the card check ploy is a proven job-killer, potentially putting hundreds of thousands of American jobs at risk in just the first year after its enactment, said Rep. Howard P. Buck McKeon (R-CA), the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee. Rather than taking away workers rights and further weakening an already struggling economy, Republicans are fighting on behalf of workers to create jobs, modernize job training, and ensure American competitiveness in the 21st century. The impact of the ˜Employee Free Choice Act will be devastating to small businesses, and to our economy. It will not create jobs and a recent study estimates that more than 600,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the legislation. The Consumer Electronics Association stated, This bill would eliminate workers' basic American right to a private ballot, and allow government bureaucrats to unilaterally set working conditions for private firms. It would harm innovation and deny technology companies the flexibility they need to compete in world markets. Almost every small and large company CEO is violently opposed to this because they want to keep jobs in the US and they want to be competitive. Even Warren Buffett agrees that this is a bad idea. In this time of national economic challenge, it is hard to imagine a more destructive proposal. Congressmen Goodlatte, Smith and McKeon are all original cosponsors of the ˜Secret Ballot Protection Act, which ensures that no one “ not a union official or a management official “ can take away a workers right to a secret ballot.
03.10.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced a bill to reauthorize grant programs that help keep kids safe from sexual predators. In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act to strengthen federal laws against child predators. Unfortunately, several programs established in the Act are scheduled to expire in 2009. The Adam Walsh Act created a national Sex Offender Registry to help state and local law enforcement track convicted sex offenders. The registry also provides the public with important information about sex offenders living in their communities. Ranking Member Smith: Today, we begin an effort that will help protect children tomorrow. Keeping kids safe from sexual predators is not about partisan politics; its the responsibility of every member of Congress. Reauthorizing and funding programs in the Adam Walsh Act will help law enforcement officials save lives. It is my hope that as a result of this legislation, fewer families will have to face the loss of a child. Though Congress authorized programs as part of the Adam Walsh Act in 2006, funding has been insufficient. Ranking Member Smith and Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.) today sent a letter to all Members urging support for full funding of the programs authorized by the Adam Walsh Act. Additional co-sponsors of the reauthorization bill include: House Judiciary Committee members Howard Coble (R-N.C.), Randy Forbes (R-Va.), Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), Ted Poe (R-Texas), Tom Rooney (R-Florida), and Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.). Representatives Dennis Cardoza (D-Calif.) and Ginny Brown-Waite (R-Florida) also cosponsored the bill.
03.05.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Representative Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) have introduced legislation to provide an effective and safe means for the disposal of unused or unwanted pharmaceuticals. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2009 aims to help prevent prescription drug abuse and minimize contamination of the nations water supply caused by the improper disposal of pharmaceuticals. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, more teenagers abuse prescription drugs than cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine combined. Prescription drug abuse is second only to marijuana use. In a 2005 Partnership for a Drug-Free America survey, 62 percent of teens said prescription pain relievers are easy to obtain from parents medicine cabinets. Ranking Member Smith: Prescription drug abuse is a growing addiction for teens across the nation. These are powerful, highly addictive drugs that when used recreationally can result in life-changing addiction or even death. To protect Americans from prescription drug abuse, we must cut it off at the source”our medicine cabinets. By helping patients dispose of unused and expired narcotics, we can keep these drugs out of the hands of children and teens. This simple change can help save lives and prevent drug addiction. Representative Stupak: As drugs that are no longer needed sit around in household medicine cabinets, millions of Americans”particularly teenagers”are turning to these unused pharmaceuticals at an alarming rate as an alternative to illegal drugs. By implementing a safe, controlled and environmentally-friendly means for disposing of unwanted drugs, we can make it harder for teens to abuse prescription drugs, while at the same time cleaning up our lakes, rivers and streams. An investigation by the Associated Press released in March 2008, found that the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans are contaminated with pharmaceuticals. The presence of these substances in the nations water supply has raised concern among scientists about long-term consequences for human health. Under current law, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires every person who distributes controlled substances to be certified by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The CSA includes an exception that allows a patient who has lawfully obtained a controlled substance by prescription to possess that controlled substance without DEA registration. However, this exception does not allow a patient to distribute the controlled substance to another entity, such as a long-term care facility, even for the purpose of disposing of the drug. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act would amend the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to allow the U.S. Attorney General to create regulations authorizing long-term care facilities to collect and dispose of controlled substances on behalf of individuals. The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
03.05.2009	The House today passed the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 (H.R. 1106) by a vote of 234-191. The bill allows homeowners facing foreclosure to petition bankruptcy judges to cram-down the amount of money they owe on their primary residences. According to a recent poll, 64 percent of Americans believe the Obama administrations housing proposal is unfair to those who pay their mortgages on time. The House bill forces the 92 percent of responsible homeowners to subsidize the mistakes of irresponsible borrowers and lenders. Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) issued the following statement in response to the House vote: The mortgage cram-down proposal will punish the successful, tax the responsible and hold no one accountable. American families and homeowners are already hard-pressed with their own financial responsibilities. Giving irresponsible borrowers a bankruptcy bailout at the expense of responsible homeowners is simply an added burden and another bill to pay. We need to do everything we can to help solve the foreclosure crisis. But we need to do so in a manner that does not bankrupt the taxpayers or our financial system. While H.R. 1106 is limited to current homeowners, it sets a dangerous precedent for future borrowers. Lenders who lose money due to the bankruptcy bailout will hesitate to lend in the future. Banks will pass on the increased risk to future homeowners in the form of higher mortgage rates, making it harder for other families to afford homeownership.
03.04.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that $143;000 for two community health centers in Real County was included at his request in the FY2009 omnibus bill; which passed the House of Representatives last week. The funding will be used for new equipment and other upgrades at Rolling Hills Health in Leakey and Canyon Health Center in Camp Wood to improve their capacity and provide the countys uninsured and underserved population with quality health care. Community health centers are a vital component of our nations health care and this federal funding will help to maintain a high level of care; improve staff efficiencies; and increase the number of patients served here in Real County; said Smith. We are appreciative to have been granted these funds through the special efforts of Congressman Smith; said Rachel Gonzales-Hanson; CEO of Community Health Development; Inc. (CHDI). It is our commitment to Congressman Smith; our patients; and all taxpayers to be good stewards of these funds. The money will be used as intended and to further our mission to provide quality care to the people of Real County and its surrounding areas. Congressman Smith was instrumental in the opening of Rolling Hills Health in 1994 and he obviously continues to demonstrate his support for Community Health Centers in Real County and across the Country.

Councilwoman McNeil and I have worked closely to obtain this funding and her advocacy on behalf of these efforts has been invaluable. I cant say how grateful we are to Congressman Smith for his hard work in acquiring these very important resources; said District 2 San Antonio City Councilwoman Sheila McNeil. It provides us a much needed opportunity to address critical challenges of a vulnerable population. This is a clear example of the tremendous things we can accomplish working together to meet the needs of San Antonio. This could not have come at a more opportune time; expressed Linda Tippins; Executive Vice President of San Antonio Fighting Back; Inc. These past few years we have seen a large reduction in resources available to our youth; add to that the economic stresses burdening our community; and what you get is an increase in youth gang violence; crime; and substance abuse.

It is an annual spending bill for Congress and is not related to the economic stimulus.
02.25.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement on HR 1105, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the house by a vote of 245 to 178. The omnibus bill, taken as a whole, with its $32 billion increase in government spending from the previous year, represents the largest one-year hike in annual appropriated spending percentage since the Carter administration, with the exception of immediately after September 11. And because many of the programs and agencies included in the bill also received funding in the recent stimulus, the combined increase is $301 billion or 80% over Fiscal Year 2008. Following what I believe was an irresponsible expansion of government spending and debt in the so-called stimulus bill, I cannot in good faith support another massive spending increase of this size, which is why I ultimately voted against it. On behalf of the interests of the constituents of TX-21 and transparency, I stand by the requests I included, but I do not support the enormous increases in spending for government bureaucracy that make up the vast majority of this bill. Reining in our growth-crushing budget deficit demands that we freeze spending at FY2008 levels. NOTE: The Fiscal Year 2009 omnibus totals $410 billion spending bill and includes nine appropriation bills that were not passed by Congress last year: Agriculture, Commerce/State/Justice, Energy and Water, Financial Services, Department of Interior, Labor/HHS, Legislative Branch, Department of State/Foreign Ops, Transportation/HUD. Funding for these government agencies and programs would increase by $32 billion, or 8.3%, over Fiscal Year 2008 (not including the funds appropriated by the recent stimulus).
02.25.2009	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today called on House Democrats to hold a hearing on the surge in drug-related violence on the U.S.-Mexico border. The violence is attributed to Mexican drug cartels, fighting turf battles and competing to control the U.S. drug trade markets. In a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-Mich.), Smith cited reports from Wall Street Journal and USA Today that Mexican gangs are operating organized crime rings in at least 230 U.S. cities. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement along with the letter: The recent surge in drug-related violence on the Southwest border has turned some American communities and neighborhoods into the ˜wild west. Drug traffickers battling for an increased share in the U.S.-Mexico drug trade market are resorting to far more violent and deadly acts. According to national news reports, this violence resulted in the deaths of at least 9,000 people since 2007. A battle is building on the border and U.S. citizens are getting caught in the cross-fire. Congress must address the violence before more lives are lost.
02.24.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that $950;000 in federal funding for City of San Antonios Fort Sam Houston infrastructure improvements will be included at his request; along with Congressman Gonzalez; in the FY2009 omnibus bill expected to pass the House of Representatives this week. The funding will be used to extend; widen and restripe Harry Wurzbach Road and Rittiman Road. Fort Sam continues to be a major engine in San Antonios economy and these much-needed improvements will help to ensure that the mutually beneficial connection between base and community; as well as service members and civilians; is stronger than ever; said Smith. BRAC 2005 is bringing tremendous growth to the Fort Sam area and the ability to move traffic in and around the base is imperative to a smooth transition to over 12;000 new and incoming civilian and military residents; said District 2 San Antonio City Councilwoman Sheila McNeil. This project is a critical step to mitigating congestion and enhancing the quality of life among our military community. Congressmen Smith has been a strong advocate for our military and this just proves his commitment. The omnibus funding bill for FY2009 is expected to pass the House and Senate this week and be sent to the President for his signature. It is an annual spending bill for Congress and is not related to the economic stimulus.
02.24.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that federal funding for Comal County will be included at his request in the FY2009 omnibus bill expected to pass the House of Representatives this week: Requesting the use of the taxpayers dollars is a responsibility that I take very seriously and I feel strongly that these projects reflect that; said Smith. This is about Main Street. It will help teens turn from lives of crime; prevent flooding; make a historic court house safer and more accessible; and enhance the downtown economy. Im elated that the County was able to participate in federal funding this year and extremely grateful to the City of New Braunfels and its staff for their work on behalf of the county and to Congressman Smith for securing this much-needed funding. It indicates that cities; counties and the federal government can work together for the good of their community; said Comal County Judge Danny Scheel. Mayor Bruce Boyer said; On behalf of the City; I want to express our sincere gratitude to Congressman Smith for his dedication and hard work on behalf of the citizens of New Braunfels and Comal County. Through this funding; the Congressman is not only ensuring that these important projects progress; he is also ensuring a positive impact upon our local economy through job creation and retention. Commerce; Justice; Science: $50;000 for the City of New Braunfels to establish a Teen Court program that will provide first-time juvenile misdemeanor offenders an alternative to the criminal justice system while ensuring they assume responsibility for their action. It provides a cost effective and successful means of handling minor juvenile offenders. Energy and Water: $3;422;000 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood prevention around Canyon Lake. Interior and Environment: $150;000 for the Comal County Courthouse historic restoration; including improving fire safety and accessibility to persons with disabilities.

Transportation and HUD: $142;500 for City of New Braunfels downtown infrastructure improvements; including relocation of overhead utilities to underground locations; which will facilitate portions of the redevelopment project; including streetscaping and drainage. The City has already contributed $111;000 to the project and has received a $14;000 Certified Local Government Grant from the Texas Historical Commission for the preliminary planning. The omnibus funding bill for FY2009 is expected to pass the House and Senate this week and be sent to the President for his signature. It is an annual spending bill for Congress and is not related to the economic stimulus.
02.24.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that federal funding for Travis County will be included at his request in the FY2009 omnibus bill expected to pass the House of Representatives this week: Requesting the use of the taxpayers dollars is a responsibility that I take very seriously and I feel strongly that these projects reflect that; said Smith. This federal funding will help keep our community safe from crime; prevent flooding; and assist the disabled; including senior citizens and veterans. Commerce; Justice; Science $350;000 for the Austin Police Department to purchase surveillance cameras and deploy them in high crimes areas in Austin. Energy and Water $406;000 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE); requested along with Representatives Conaway; Edwards; Paul; and Senators Cornyn and Hutchison; to complete the Williamson Creek study to identify flood prone areas and continue other feasibility studies within the Lower Colorado River basin. $1;264;000 for ACE; requested along with Representatives Doggett; Edwards; Paul and Senator Cornyn; to be used for the Onion Creek Flood Control and Ecosystem Restoration; a joint project of ACE; the City of Austin; Travis County; and Lower Colorado River Authority.

The omnibus funding bill for FY2009 is expected to pass the House and Senate this week and be sent to the President for his signature. It is an annual spending bill for Congress and is not related to the economic stimulus.
02.24.2009	Representatives Lamar Smith (TX-21) and John Carter (TX-31) today announced that $2;612;500 for Capitol Metro and $350;000 for the Austin Police Department will be included at their request in the omnibus funding bill expected to pass the House of Representatives this week. Capitol Metro will use the federal funding for its Paratransit service; which provides door-to-door transportation for persons with disabilities and senior citizens. The APD will use its money to purchase surveillance cameras and deploy them in high crimes areas in Austin. This federal funding will help Austin meet needs in two important areas. Central Texas disabled population; including many of our returning veterans; depends on Capital Metros Paratransit services to get to work; classes and medical appointments; said Smith. And the surveillance cameras will give APD the capability to monitor violent crime hotspots and make our city safer. My preference was for an Omnibus bill that freezes federal spending to fight the spiraling deficit; says Carter. But with that proposal heading for defeat; I am pleased that we at least succeeded in winning these two important grants for Texas. If its going to be spent anyway; its better to spend it here on projects that help the disabled and improve public safety than send Texas dollars elsewhere. The omnibus funding bill for FY2009 is expected to pass the House and Senate this week and be sent to the President for his signature. It is an annual spending bill for Congress and is not related to the economic stimulus.
02.23.2009	Members of Congress Lamar Smith (TX-21); Ciro D. Rodriguez (TX-23); and Henry Cuellar (TX-28) today touted nearly $11.2 million secured in funding for projects in the Fiscal Year 2009 omnibus Appropriations bill including $10 million for the San Antonio Channel Improvement Project on the San Antonio River and $1;187;500 for various airfield improvements at the San Antonio International Airport. For San Antonians and visitors alike; the river is the public face of our community and the airport; located in TX-21; helps to connect that community to the world; said Smith. Federal funding for both of these key projects will contribute to our future economic growth and help to ensure that San Antonio continues to be a world-class city. As a member of the Appropriations Committee; I am proud to have worked to secure funding for projects in San Antonio and other communities in my district; said Rodriguez. This year well bring home money again for our river and for a better airport that will help lead the way for more economic development in our great city. In todays challenging economic times; these major funds for the San Antonio River are a welcome investment in the citys economy; said Cuellar. Not only will they help to prevent flooding and protect the rivers natural resources; but they will create jobs in San Antonio and build infrastructure that will serve the community for years to come. The funding bill for 2009 is expected to pass the House and Senate this week and be sent to the President for his signature. It is the annual spending bill for Congress and is not tied to the American Recovery Act passed by Congress this month.
02.19.2009	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Senator John Cornyn have introduced legislation that directs Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to retain subscriber information for up to two years. The Internet Safety Act (H.R. 1076) helps law enforcement officials identify users who upload and view explicit child pornography. Congressman Smith and Senator Cornyn, who made the announcement at a press conference in Austin, were joined by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and Cathy Crabtree, Executive Director for the Childrens Advocacy Centers of Texas. Congressman Smith: Of the nearly 600,000 images of graphic child pornography found online and reported to law enforcement officials, only 2,100 of these children have been identified and rescued. Federal, state and local law enforcement officials have reached a digital dead end in their battle against the online sexual exploitation of children. Investigators need the assistance of Internet Service Providers to identify users and distributers of online child pornography. The Internet Safety Act requires ISPs to retain subscriber records, similar to records retained by telephone companies, to aid law enforcement officials in their fight against child pornography. If we require phone companies to retain this same type of information, there is no reason why the law should not be updated to require ISPs to do so as well. Senator Cornyn: Im proud to join my colleague Lamar Smith from the House of Representatives in announcing our legislation, the Internet Safety Act, to combat Internet predators and create a safer environment for Texas children. It is our hope that we can garner the support of all our colleagues and pass this bill to strengthen penalties for child sex offenders and Internet predators. While the Internet has generated many positive changes in the way we communicate and do business, its limitless nature offers anonymity that has opened the door to criminals looking to harm innocent children. Keeping our children safe requires cooperation on the local, state, federal and family level. Attorney General Abbott: With sexual predators increasingly using new technology to prey upon children, it is critical that law enforcement stay ahead of the criminals. Innovative legislative responses to high tech crimes are vital to the ongoing success of our crackdown on cyber predators and online child pornographers. Thanks to creative legislative initiatives at both the state and federal levels, law enforcement will have the legal tools we need to help protect Texas children. In addition to record retention, the Internet Safety Act also makes it a crime to financially facilitate the sale, distribution and purchase of child pornography. The bill also provides additional funds to the FBIs Innocent Images, the backbone of federal law enforcements fight to eradicate child pornography. Senator Cornyn introduced the Senate version of the bill.
02.13.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined other House Republicans in urging the Obama Administration to maintain an independent Census Bureau. Recent news reports indicate that the Obama White House is considering an unprecedented shift in management of the 2010 census by requiring the Director of the Census Bureau to report directly to political appointees in the White House. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement regarding the need for accountability in the 2010 Census: The Constitution requires that the populations of each state be determined every 10 years and that Representatives shall be apportioned to the states according to their numbers. The census plays a central role in determining how many representatives each state receives, where district lines are drawn, and how much federal funding goes to each state. Politicizing or abusing this non-partisan system is nothing short of an attack on democracy. The Administration claims that there is precedent for shifting control of the census from the Census Bureau to the White House. So we contacted the Congressional Research Service to check that statement, and they have found no written record that any previous Administration shifted control of census determinations from the Commerce Department to the White House. There simply is no precedent to excuse this blatant power grab by the Obama Administration. There will be no accountability if management of the census is moved to the White House. The Administration will simply claim executive privilege and any misuse or politicization of the census will go unexposed. Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held over 70 hearings looking into allegations that the Bush Administration politicized the Justice Department. But the politicization of the Census Bureau is far worse than any allegations regarding the removal of several U.S. Attorneys. It threatens our democracy. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Oversight & Government Reform Ranking Member Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) led todays press conference announcing a Census Task Force to conduct oversight of the Obama Administrations decision. Ranking Member Smith will serve as a member of that Task Force to ensure that there is no politicization of the 2010 census.
02.11.2009	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Congressman Lamar Smith yesterday on the House Floor made the following statement in support of H.Con.Res. 35; recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the NAACP: Mr. Speaker; I support House Concurrent Resolution 35; which recognizes the 100th Anniversary of the NAACP. For a century now; the NAACP has fought to bring justice and racial equality to all of America. In 1917; the NAACP won a legal victory in the Supreme Court; which held that states could not restrict and officially segregate black Americans into residential districts. The same year; the NAACP fought for the right of black Americans to be commissioned as officers in World War I. In 1935; NAACP lawyers Charles Houston and Thurgood Marshall won a legal battle to admit a black student to the University of Maryland. During World War II; the NAACP led the effort that resulted in President Franklin Roosevelts ordering a non-discrimination policy in war-related industries and federal employment. And in 1948; the NAACP convinced President Harry Truman to sign an Executive Order banning discrimination by the Federal government. In 1954; under the leadership of Special Counsel Thurgood Marshall; the NAACP won one of its greatest legal victories in Brown v. the Board of Education; which found segregated schools and other educational facilities in the United States to be unlawful. In 1960; in Greensboro; North Carolina; members of the NAACP Youth Council launched a series of non-violent sit-ins at segregated lunch counters. The segregation ended. The history of Americas modern struggle to live up to our constitutional principles includes a major role by the NAACP; and it continues to champion the cause of social justice today. It is with pleasure that I join in supporting this concurrent resolution; which I hope raises even greater awareness of this organizations historic contributions to the cause of civil rights.
02.11.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, today was joined by 19 Republican members of the Texas Delegation in calling on President Obama to keep Texas safe from Guantanamo Bay detainees. Recent news reports have listed Texas facilities as possible locations to house the detainees once the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is closed. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement as part of todays letter: The Obama Administrations decision to close Guantanamo Bay was premature at best and dangerous at worst. The detainee population at Gitmo contains the ˜worst of the worst known terrorists. At least 61 former detainees have returned to terrorist activities and one is suspected of orchestrating last Septembers deadly attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. The transfer or release of Gitmo detainees presents a clear and present danger to all Americans. As Members of Congress, it is our responsibility to act in the best interest of our constituents. If transferred to prisons in Texas, these alleged terrorists are likely to be given constitutional rights. That means they could petition friendly federal judges who may order their release into Texas communities. While we are concerned about the location of detainees anywhere in the United States, as members of Congress from Texas, we have a special interest in our state. The Obama Administration must take our request seriously. We will do everything in our power to prevent the transfer or release of known-terrorists into the neighborhoods and communities of Texas. On January 22, President Obama issued an executive order to close Guantanamo Bay within one year. As part of the review process, Gitmo detainees will be vetted into three groups: 1) detainees believed to be ˜safe for release; 2) detainees the Administration plans to prosecute; and 3) detainees who are too dangerous for release and cannot be prosecuted, therefore must be further detained. Ranking Member Smith recently introduced legislation (H.R. 630) to prevent federal judges from ordering the release or transfer of Gitmo detainees into the U.S. He has also called on the Obama Administration to ensure transparency and accountability in the Gitmo detainee review process by issuing a public report on the Administrations conclusions before the release or transfer of any detainee.

02.11.2009	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today joined a bipartisan group of members in calling for the direct election of all Senators, including those who would fill vacancies. The members introduced a constitutional amendment that requires all Senators to be elected by the people of the state. Rules Committee Ranking Member David Dreier (R-Calif.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-Mich.), who led the effort, were also joined by Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) and House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.). Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement regarding the need for a constitutional amendment: The House Judiciary Committee is the guardian of the Constitution. I take constitutional amendments very seriously and think long and hard before giving my support. In this case, a constitutional amendment is not only justified, but necessary to restore integrity to the Senate. Nearly 100 years ago, Congress debated a constitutional amendment calling for the public election of Senators by the people rather than the state legislature. This was necessary because the system had been corrupted by intimidation and bribery: Senate seats were for sale. Congress passed the 17th Amendment and the following year all Senators were elected by the people of the state. Unfortunately, the 17th Amendment has had an unintentional constitutional consequence that needs to be corrected. Senate vacancies are still filled by the Governor of the state. When there is a vacancy in the House of Representatives, the people vote to elect a new member. It should be the same in the Senate. Sometimes politicians are a little lower than angels. So the system should be revised to eliminate temptation and abuse and give the people the power to decide who will serve in the Senate. That is the essence of democracy.
02.02.2009	Today at the Christmas Gallery -- a locally-owned small business -- as the federal government considers one of the largest spending sprees in the nations history, Congressman Lamar Smith outlined the true cost of the economic stimulus package passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. As the federal government prepares to deliver billions of dollars in gifts to state and local governments across the country, said Smith, some would have you believe that the $825 billion economic stimulus is the equivalent of a Christmas present. Unfortunately, the federal government is not Santa Claus. Elves are not making this money, said Smith, This money isnt free and the American people will pay the bill. This unprecedented deficit spending will inevitably hike inflation and lead to increased taxes, said Smith. I did not support this bill, nor did any House Republican. In fact, it had bipartisan opposition. Eleven Democrats voted against it because it is a bad bill. Smith is also concerned that only $90 billion, or 12%, of the massive $825 billion plan is anything that could be considered stimulus spending that would create jobs soon. According to the Congressional Budget Office, only 20% of the funds will be spent in the first year when Americans and the economy need it most. More than $250 billion of the plan is actually in the form of income-transfer payments to the states. States that were fiscally more conservative like Texas are bailing out the multi-billion dollar deficits of states like California and New York that spent lavishly when times were good, said Smith. Smith pointed out that Texas is only getting 3% of the stimulus money while it has about 8% of the countrys population. The federal government is rewarding irresponsible behavior by bailing out states that overspent their budget, said Smith. Meanwhile states like Texas that lived within its means are penalized for responsible behavior. House Democrats say the proposed stimulus is intended to create or save 3 million jobs. That means that the legislation will spend about $275,000 per job. The average household income in the U.S. is $50,000 a year. We've already had the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which cost $150 billion. We've had the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which burned through $350 billion with nothing to show for it, said Smith. I think we should gauge the impact of the TARP funds already approved before throwing good money after bad. Smith instead supports a Republican alternative. The GOP proposal would cut small business taxes by 20%. Small businesses employ half of all working Americans. This will lead to the immediate creation of new jobs. Using the methodology of the Presidents nominee to head the council of economic advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, House Republicans calculate that their plan will create twice as many jobs “ 6.2 million “ at half the cost of the so-called stimulus package. The GOP proposal also would reduce taxes across the board and increase the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $5,000, which would provide a substantial, immediate tax cut for middle-class families. It would be far more effective to provide tax incentives and investment credits to the small businesses that create 70% of the new jobs in America than to send the American people a bill for $825 billion, said Smith.
01.28.2009	Citing that the bill fails to stimulate the economy and may make matters worse, Congressman Lamar Smith today voted against H.R. 1 “ The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The bill passed the House, 244 “ 188. During the floor debate of the legislation, Smith made the following statement: Here are a half dozen of many reasons to oppose this legislation: We should wait and gauge the impact of the $350 billion in TARP funds already approved before spending even more. Spending another $825 billion -- $6,000 for every taxpayer in America “ will inevitably hike inflation and increase taxes, further damaging the economy. Much of the money will be used to bail out states that have overspent their budget. This rewards bad behavior. What happened to the era of responsibility%3f This is not free money. Its a non-secure loan extracted from the American people. Let them keep the dollars and decide how to spend them. It would be far better to provide tax incentives and investment credits to the small businesses that create 70% of the new jobs in America. This massive monstrosity of spending is the wrong kind of change. It will only make the economic crisis wider, deeper and longer. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the $825-billion package will be financed by borrowing, which will result in additional interest costs of $347 billion. When these interest costs are taken into account, the total cost of the package reaches $1.2 trillion. Instead, Smith supports the Republican alternative, H.R. 470 “ The Economic Recovery and Middle-Class Tax Relief Act, which provides tax relief for families, unleashes Americas businesses and entrepreneurs to create jobs, and saves future generations from a crushing debt burden.
01.22.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith this week announced that Canyon Lake Fire/EMS will receive a $975,420 Assistance to Firefighters Grant from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The federal funding comes from the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program, which is intended to support the hiring of firefighters and the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters. These targeted federal funds will help Canyon Lake Fire/EMS to maintain the 24-hour staffing necessary to protect the community, said Smith. By creating a more favorable working environment for our brave volunteer firefighters, we encourage current volunteers to continue their service and prospective volunteers to enlist. DHS awards approximately $190 million annually to fire departments and volunteer groups across the nation in order to expand the ranks of firefighters and enhance emergency-preparedness efforts. Volunteer, career, and combination fire departments are eligible to apply. For more information, go to www.firegrantsupport.com.
01.22.2009	House Republicans today introduced legislation to prohibit federal courts from ordering the release or transfer of Gitmo detainees into the U.S. The Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act (H.R. 630) establishes clear rules regarding the detention of known terrorists. President Obama today signed an executive order to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, raising concerns about the release of dangerous detainees. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement regarding this new legislation: Closing Guantanamo Bay presents a clear and present danger to all Americans. These suspected terrorists must now be relocated and if they are transferred to military prisons in the U.S., they automatically will be granted rights far beyond those given to enemy combatants by any other country. The result is that many will petition friendly federal judges who may order their release into U.S. communities. This important legislation ensures that no foreign terrorist can be released by a court onto U.S. soil, prevents the disclosure of sensitive intelligence information and protects American lives. But thats not the only concern with closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. A recent Pentagon report found that out of those Gitmo detainees already released, 61 have returned to terrorist activities. Before any more steps are taken, the Obama Administration must assure the American people of two things. First, that the released detainees will not return to the battlefield to once again target innocent Americans or attack U.S or allied forces. And second, that no Gitmo detainees will be released or transferred onto U.S. soil, where they could be released into American communities. Specifically, the Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act prohibits a federal court from ordering the government to bring enemy combatants into the U.S. and ensures that an alien captured and detained abroad during wartime cannot be admitted and released in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) was joined today by Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Judiciary Committee Members Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) Daniel Lungren (R-Calif.), Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Ted Poe (R-Texas), Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), Howard Coble (R-NC), and Tom Rooney (R-Fla.).
01.21.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith voted today against H.R. 384, the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) Reform and Accountability Act, which passed the House 260 to 166. The legislation will place taxpayers on the hook for an additional $350 billion investment for a Treasury program that has been managed with little transparency, no accountability, and in a way entirely inconsistent with how it was sold to Congress. Signed into law last fall, TARP funds were intended to buy ""toxic assets"" to help unlock the credit markets at the center of the financial crisis. Instead, the Treasury Department utilized funds to help financial institutions acquire other banks, additional funds went to the auto companies, and still more taxpayer money is unaccounted for. The time for bailouts is over, said Smith. Enough is enough. This money doesnt belong to the government “ its pried from the pockets of the American people and has been used in an unacceptable spendthrift manner. Smith argued that the better solution is to support families through tax relief and provide economic relief for American businesses and entrepreneurs who create jobs and spur economic growth. This money is going to get spent “ the decision is whether to let the bureaucracy decide how or to let you decide, said Smith, Whom do you trust more to do what is best for your family%3f Smith added, The United States of America did not tax, spend and borrow its way into becoming the largest most successful economy in the history of the world. Rather, the American people created this success because they have been free to reap the rewards of their own hard work and ingenuity.
01.14.2009	Arguing that it undermines private health insurance and does not do enough to cover low-income uninsured kids, Congressman Lamar Smith today opposed the Democratic Majoritys bill “ H.R. 2 “ to reauthorize the State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The bill passed the House 289 to 139. In the last Congress, we reauthorized and fully funded SCHIP through March 31, 2009, which I supported, said Smith. The Democrats should not be allowed to rush this partisan and poorly constructed bill through the legislative process. Instead, we need to work in a bipartisan manner to develop a long-term reauthorization of SCHIP that puts low-income, uninsured kids first. In opposing the reauthorization, House Republicans criticized Democrats for: ¢ Spending billions of dollars to substitute government-run healthcare coverage for private health insurance coverage. ¢ Enabling illegal aliens to fraudulently enroll in Medicaid and SCHIP. ¢ Increasing the number of adults on SCHIP, which allows even more resources to be taken away from low-income, uninsured kids. In its official analysis of the bill, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that half of the 1.1 million new enrollees in the expansion of SCHIP already have private health insurance coverage. For instance, under the expansion, in some states families of four making more than $74,000 a year and families of five making more than $86,000 a year will be eligible for government health insurance. Smith instead supported the Republican amendment to the bill, which would: ¢ Reauthorize SCHIP through Fiscal Year 2015, extending the program for six and a half years “ two longer than the Democrat bill. ¢ Cover poor children first by requiring states to cover 90% of children in families making less than 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) “ $42,400 for a family of four in 2008 “ before expanding their SCHIP programs to children in families with income more than 200% FPL. ¢ Limit states ability to ignore portions of applicants income for eligibility purposes to no more than $250 per month or $3,000 per year, in order to maintain SCHIPs focus on covering targeted low-income children. Smith said he will continue to support responsible legislation that insures those in need.
01.14.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith this week voted in favor of H. Res. 50, which honors the life, achievements, and distinguished career of Senator Claiborne Pell, who passed away on January 1, 2009, at the age of 90 in Newport, Rhode Island. Federal Pell Grants, which bear his name, have helped more than 54 million low- and middle-income students attend college and achieve their educational goals. Americas most important resource is our children, whose talent and potential we can not allow to go untapped, said Smith. The legacy of the late Senator Pell is one of helping individuals overcome barriers to higher education. Today, the federal government provides more than $96 billion annually to help millions of students and families pay for postsecondary education. The Higher Education Act was established in 1965 to help low and middle-income students pursue higher education. Last year, the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which was the first reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 10 years, passed the House with Smiths support and was signed into law. A secure financial aid system is an essential part of our nations higher education policy and transparency of that system is needed, said Congressman Smith. Higher education must be both accessible and affordable and colleges and universities need to be accountable to students and families paying for education. Under that bipartisan bill, colleges and universities must now report reasons for tuition increases and the steps theyll take to correct inefficiencies. It also provides for the creation of a website where parents and students will be able to go to search, compare and watch college costs. And notably, it increased the maximum amount for a Pell grant to $6,000 in 2009 and up to $8,000 in 2014 and offers year-round Pell grant availability to students.
01.09.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today announced that for the new Congress he will serve on three House Committees: Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Science. Smith was re-elected to serve as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee and was re-appointed as the second most senior Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee and the third most senior Republican on the House Science and Technology Committee. As the highest ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Smith helps shapes the agenda for issues including immigration, national security, intellectual property and law enforcement. Through the Homeland Security Committee “ which was formed after September 11 to oversee the development of the Department of Homeland Security “ Smith further focuses on the security of our nations borders and ports of entry. As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, Smith oversees all non-defense federal scientific research and development at a number of federal agencies, including NASA, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
01.08.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today issued the following statement in support of Israel: The sovereign nation of Israel “ a democracy and our steadfast ally “ is entirely justified in taking military action in the Gaza strip to defend itself from the terrorist organization Hamas, which indiscriminately targets Israeli civilians and uses innocent Palestinians as human shields. Hamas consistently demonstrates with actions and words that it has no desire for peace. In 2008, thousands of rockets and mortars were fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip into communities in southern Israel. However, Israelis are not the only ones to be targeted by Hamas terror. Recently, Khaled Abu Toameh a journalist for The Jerusalem Post, who is Arab, reported that 35 members of the Palestinian Fatah Party were executed in Gaza by Hamas, while more than twice that number were shot in the legs or had their hands broken. In the face of such wanton terror and hatred, the United States and all civilized nations must stand with the people of Israel, as well as the innocent Palestinians, who are being exploited by Hamas and its sponsor Iran. Israel has demonstrated that it wants peace, but that can not be achieved until the terrorist attacks on its citizens cease.
01.05.2009	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) and Congresswoman Mary Jo Kilroy (OH-15) today made a friendly wager over the outcome of tonights Tostitos Fiesta Bowl between No. 3 Texas (11-1) and No. 10 Ohio State (10-2). Smith; whose congressional district includes UT; bet Kilroy; who represents OSU; pecan pie and Amys Ice Cream from Austin against chocolate buckeyes and Jenis Ice Creams from Columbus. Ohio State is always a formidable opponent; but Im confident the Longhorns will show that UT deserves to be in the national title discussion; said Smith. ""I am proud to make this bet in a bipartisan nature; but I fully expect a convincing Buckeye victory to win the rubber match between these great schools;"" said Kilroy. Ohio State and Texas will meet for the third time in history with the series tied one game apiece. The Longhorns won the first meeting; 25-22; on Sept. 10; 2005; in Columbus; while the Buckeyes won the second meeting; 24-7; on Sept. 9; 2006; in Austin. Ohio State finished the regular season 10-2 and earned a share of the Big Ten Championship for the fourth consecutive year. The Buckeyes will be making their seventh trip to a BCS bowl game (4-2 record). Texas finished the regular season 11-1; extending the NCAA-leading and school record mark of at least 10 wins in eight straight seasons. The Longhorns are playing in their third BCS game in the last five years (2-0 record).
12.19.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith and a bipartisan group of House members this week wrote President Bush to ask that he direct the Treasury to suspend required minimum distribution rules for IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s for the 2008 tax year, and allow recontributions by those who have already made mandatory withdrawals this year. According to Smith, the measure will help provide some relief to retirees whose savings have taken a hit due to the economic crisis and volatile markets. These rules were suspended for the 2009 tax year as part of HR 7327, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act, which passed the House and Senate last week. But, the Treasury has the ability to change the requirements for the current tax year. The full text of the letter to President Bush follows: Dear Mr. President, It is our understanding that you are on schedule to sign H.R. 7327, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, in the next few days. This legislation contains an important provision temporarily waiving the required minimum distribution rules for IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s for the 2009 tax year. We respectfully request that you use your executive authority to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to use the flexibility provided by statute to immediately waive the same rules for the 2008 tax year. Furthermore, we ask that you use the same authority to allow retirees who have already withdrawn in 2008 to make recontributions to their accounts. By doing this, you will allow retirees to protect some of their savings during these rough economic times. While the Internal Revenue Code requires retired individuals to begin taking withdrawals the later of the year after they retire or the year after they turn 70 ½, it is our understanding that Treasury regulations set the specific intervals and penalties, and therefore the distribution requirements could be adjusted for 2008 without Congressional action.
12.19.2008	Today President Bush announced a $17.4 billion rescue package for the Detroit auto makers that allows them to avoid bankruptcy. The money will come from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Earlier this week, Congressman Lamar Smith joined other House Republicans in signing a letter to the President opposing the use of TARP funds for an auto bailout. The letter stated: The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act was intended to provide stability to the nations lending system”not to provide a taxpayer-funded capital infusion to favored businesses¦ Congress never voted for a federal bailout of the automobile industry, and the only way for TARP funds to be diverted to domestic automakers is with explicit congressional approval. No one wants the ˜Big Three to fail, and we are not proposing it. But the federal government cannot undo decades of mismanagement, so we are faced with a decision about how to deal with it. Exercising options already afforded them by law, under a Chapter 11 reorganization for example, the American automobile industry can make the necessary reforms and could soon return to profitability. A federal bailout of the automobile industry, on the other hand, would put taxpayer money at risk, shield the companies from making the reforms necessary to restore competitiveness again, and set a costly precedent that the federal government will bailout other failing companies and industries. When Smith voted against the House Democrat auto rescue proposal he said that never-ending bailouts are not the answer, adding Any funds for government spending must first be taken out of the economy in the form of taxes or borrowing. The American people should not be forced to make an unsecured loan that may never be repaid. The full text of the letter to President Bush follows: December 15, 2008 Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our concerns over the possibility of funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) being used to bail out the Big Three auto manufacturers. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act was intended to provide stability to the nations lending system”not to provide a taxpayer-funded capital infusion to favored businesses. The legislation allows the $700 billion to be used for leveraging financial institutions, which auto manufacturers surely are not. Congress never voted for a federal bailout of the automobile industry, and the only way for TARP funds to be diverted to domestic automakers is with explicit congressional approval. No one wants the Big Three to fail, and we are not proposing it. But the federal government cannot undo decades of mismanagement, so we are faced with a decision about how to deal with it. Exercising options already afforded them by law, under a Chapter 11 reorganization for example, the American automobile industry can make the necessary reforms and could soon return to profitability. A federal bailout of the automobile industry, on the other hand, would put taxpayer money at risk, shield the companies from making the reforms necessary to restore competitiveness again, and set a costly precedent that the federal government will bailout other failing companies and industries. Tempting as it is to step in with a federal bailout, American taxpayers cannot afford to save every company facing financial peril. Last years federal deficit was the highest nominal deficit in U.S. history, and many economists believe this years deficit will exceed $1 trillion. For the long-term stability of our nation and our automotive manufacturers, we urge you to not expand the use of TARP money to bailout American auto manufacturers.
12.10.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) was re-elected today to serve as Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee for the 111th Congress. As the highest ranking Republican on the Committee, Congressman Smith shapes the Republican agenda for Committee issues including immigration, national security, intellectual property and law enforcement. Smith was voted Ranking Member by the Republican Conference, which includes all Republican members of the House of Representatives. Smith served his first term as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee during the last Congress.
12.10.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today voted against H.R. 7321, the $14 billion taxpayer-funded auto bailout proposed by House Democratic leaders, which passed by a vote of 237 to 170. He issued the following statement: This is an expensive way to put off a real solution. The proposal does not provide enough money to overcome the fatal flaws of Detroits business model and yet it makes matters worse by delaying the very restructuring needed for the industry to become profitable and competitive. No one wants the auto makers to go out of business and they wont. We just want them to have a good business, be profitable, and make cars for years to come. The Democrats proposal will put the American taxpayer on the line for billions of dollars with no guarantee that the restructuring will occur. The Republican alternative would urge the automakers to accomplish their needed restructuring through a pre-packaged bankruptcy or other mechanism that brings all the stakeholders to the table. This will put the companies on equal footing with the foreign manufacturers, which employ thousands of people here in America by making cars profitably. The larger question is when do the bailouts stop%3f When we start down the path of specific industries, where do we draw the line%3f There are thousands of businesses large and small that could benefit from a government bailout. This legislation is not the answer. Any funds for government spending must first be taken out of the economy in the form of taxes or borrowing. The American people should not be forced to make an unsecured loan that may never be repaid. House Republicans are proposing the following alternative: The American Automotive Reorganization and Recovery Plan. On December 2, the Detroit automakers presented to Congress their plans for restructuring. While the plans included laudable goals, too few details were provided as to how the companies will achieve the restructuring and the savings they have promised. In some instances, new agreements to achieve the savings would not be entered into for months or years. The automakers must lock in the promised restructuring in a matter of weeks, not months or years. Congress should instead establish firm benchmarks and a tight timeline for restructuring. Such benchmarks will include the requirement that by March 31, 2009 each company should reach an agreement whereby: The companies creditors agree to a framework to reduce each companys indebtedness by at least 1/3. The UAW holds to concessions already made and further: o Concedes the elimination of supplemental unemployment benefits. o Concedes elimination of the jobs bank program. o Agrees to either reduce company retiree health care obligations or otherwise convert a portion of such obligations into equity. o Agrees to reduce wages and benefits to the levels paid by non-Big Three manufacturers. Because of the many legal and contractual hurdles to restructuring, the companies are urged to accomplish their restructuring through the use of a pre-packaged bankruptcy or another mechanism to bring all stakeholders to the table for an agreed-upon determination of their future. It is important that these stakeholders reach reasonable compromises with each other. Creating a government bureaucracy or a car czar to arbitrarily pass judgment on the thousands of details involved with a restructuring is the equivalent to nationalizing the auto companies. The Big Three may need some form of interim financing as they finalize their restructuring. In better economic conditions, if their restructuring plan was considered viable, such financing should be available in the private sector. However, because of the current credit crisis, limited assistance may be appropriate in the form of insurance, rather than a taxpayer-funded government bailout that replaces private investment. House Republicans propose that the government provide insurance, funded by the participants with a modest FDIC-like fee, which would cover up to 50 percent of the losses of new investment in the case of default, helping to unlock immediate private investment (not unlike debtor in possession financing). Such insurance would expire on March 31, 2009. This proposal ensures that taxpayers are protected and provides a powerful incentive for the auto makers to quickly implement their restructuring plans, saving thousands of jobs.

10.14.2008	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today issued the following statement regarding recent reports that the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) submitted fraudulent voter registration information. Reports that ACORN registered ˜Mickey Mouse to vote are deeply disturbing. American voters depend on their government to ensure that their votes are fairly counted in an election. Unfortunately, organizations like ACORN that perpetuate voter fraud, continue to plague the American electoral system. Congress must make it clear that ACORN, and organizations like it, will not be allowed to steal votes and potentially influence elections. I urge the Justice Department and state election authorities to take immediate action and restore integrity to the November elections. I also urge House Democrats to join me in requesting that the Justice Department investigate all alleged instances of voter registration fraud, including those involving ACORN.
10.14.2008	On Monday, President Bush signed a bill into law that protects American innovations and ensures intellectual property enforcement will remain a priority for future Administrations. The Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property (PRO-IP) Act of 2008 (S. 3325) received strong bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House by a vote of 381-41 and the Senate by unanimous consent. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Chairman John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) introduced the original PRO-IP Act in December 2007. The Senate version was sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) and Ranking Member Arlen Specter (R-Pa.). Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement regarding the bill: Intellectual property industries are a driving force in the American economy, accounting for over half of all U.S. exports, representing 40 percent of the countrys economic growth and employing 18 million American workers. As families across the nation face economic uncertainty, Congress must ensure that American innovations are protected and American businesses remain competitive. The PRO-IP bill strengthens current laws against counterfeiting and piracy, provides additional resources to key enforcement agencies and mandates a new and unprecedented level of leadership and coordination from the White House. By signing this bill into law, the President has made IP enforcement a top priority for future Administrations. The PRO-IP bill is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerces Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy, which includes more than 500 businesses and associations.

10.07.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that San Antonio College (SAC) was selected to receive a $1,188,989 grant from the U.S. Department of Educations College Cost Reduction program. The federal funding will be used to increase the number of Hispanic and low-income students attaining degrees in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math from SAC and Texas State University. If our nation is to remain competitive in the global economy, we need as many young people as possible studying and excelling in science, technology, engineering and math, said Smith. For that to happen, we need higher education in these subjects to be accessible for people of all backgrounds and income-levels. San Antonio College is proud to partner with our neighbor Texas State University-San Marcos, to increase the numbers of Hispanic and low-income students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, said SAC President Robert E. Zeigler. Zeigler explained that SAC serves more than 10,000 Hispanics each semester, and Texas State has extremely high rates of retention and graduation for the 22% of its enrollment that is Hispanic. Additionally, he mentioned that according to March 2008 rankings in The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, SAC ranked 18th nationally in awarding of associate degrees to Hispanics. By working together, SAC will be able to provide more effective STEM instruction and support to Hispanic Texans, and remove obstacles in their path to STEM careers. Texas State will be able to offer its excellent STEM education to more Hispanics, said Zeigler.
10.06.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today visited Presto Printing to meet with San Antonio small business leaders and to discuss how the credit crisis is affecting the local business community. He was joined by Presto Printing President Wanda Chandler Rohm, San Antonio Manufacturers Association (SAMA) President Mike Harris, Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) of San Antonio Chairwoman Michelle Seward Davis, and ABC President Steven Schultz. Small businesses, which are the engine of our economy, are particularly vulnerable during a credit crisis, said Smith. In a recent National Small Business Association (NSBA) survey, 67% of business owners reported being affected by the credit crunch in August, up from 55% in February. If they can't find alternative sources of credit, the result may be a cutback in expansion plans, layoffs, or even a complete shutdown. When small businesses can't get credit, tax revenue decrease, and job growth and expansion in the larger economy stall, said Smith. Manufacturers are very encouraged by the passage of the Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008, said Mike Harris, president of SAMA. Manufacturers, as well as most businesses, depend on an effective functioning of our capital markets. A credit crisis throughout our economy results in businesses that cannot borrow to expand, grow, and, more importantly, to make day-to-day operational commitments and payroll. Consumers cannot consume and manufacturers cannot manufacture if the credit system is not in place. The change will not occur overnight but, hopefully this legislative action will put our economy back on the road to recovery. Smith emphasized that in addition to businesses, if credit to buy homes, cars and other purchases dries up, home prices will fall even further and loans will become even harder to get. This will adversely impact the entire economy and punish hard-working Americans. My priority is protect American jobs, the financial security of families, retirement accounts and pension plans, and to stabilize the financial markets, said Smith.
09.29.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement after supporting the amended Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed the House by a vote of 263 to 171 and was signed by the President. Much of our economic crisis today is rooted in misguided policies of the past. Permitting home mortgages with nothing down was a disaster waiting to happen when home prices fell. Unfortunately, all the bad mortgages and the resulting credit crisis have dragged down our economy and threatened the financial well-being of all Americans. I have heard from many constituents of the 21st District regarding this legislation. How best to address our economic crisis has been the source of much debate and frustration. In supporting this legislation my first priority was to protect American taxpayers. It is important to make sure that those who have acted responsibly are not punished and that their financial future remains stable and secure. Improvements were made to the plan to address my concerns. Measures were included to ensure Wall Street pays its share and taxpayers are protected. We are facing the economic equivalent of a cattle stampede. To stop a stampede, you have to act quickly and decisively and get ahead of the herd to turn it. This plan, while not perfect, does that. The legislation includes more government oversight, restricts executive pay, protects taxpayers by prohibiting the unjust enrichment of participating companies, and promotes transparency by requiring full disclosure of the transactions conducted by the Treasury Department. The amended legislation also includes a one-year patch to the Alternative Minimum Tax, without which 21 million middle class families would have seen a total of $62 billion in tax increases. The bill includes tax credits for research and development, to encourage the installation of wind, solar and biomass power plants, and for hybrid plug-in vehicles. More importantly for Texas, a state which has no income tax, this legislation will continue to allow residents to deduct state and local sales taxes from their federal income tax returns. If companies big and small cannot access funds they need to operate and pay employees, this will adversely impact the entire economy and punish hard-working Americans. If credit to buy homes, cars and other purchases dries up, home prices will fall even further and loans will become even harder to get. This legislation protects American jobs, the financial security of families, and the economy of our nation. Half of all households own stocks either directly or indirectly through 401(k) accounts, IRAs, and pension plans. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act will stabilize the financial markets and restore investor confidence. The money in the compromise plan will be used to purchase the mortgage-related assets at the center of the problem. When the financial markets stabilize, many of those assets will regain their value and will be sold by the federal government to recover a substantial portion of the cost for taxpayers. I believe the plan will stabilize the economy, strengthen home values, and prevent a devastating recession. It is designed to be an investment in the future of the American people.
09.25.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that at his request $1.2 million in Defense appropriations for the University of Texas at Austin was included in the Continuing Resolution spending bill; which was passed by the House of Representatives. The funding will be used to establish a research and education program for enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the cutting-edge field of next generation manufacturing processes and systems. The research will involve the use of physics-based models; state-of-the-art analysis and control; and advanced materials to develop the next generation of manufacturing processes and systems. UT Austin and Central Texas have a well-earned reputation for innovation and entrepreneurship and this federal funding helps to build on our strengths; said Smith. If we are to keep pace in the global economy; it will largely depend on the ability of our education system -- particularly higher education “ along with the public and private sectors to work together on research; technology transfer and commercialization. In this case; advances in next generation manufacturing will have implications for nearly every corner of our economy. The initial focus of the program will be on flexible and rapid response next generation manufacturing and de-manufacturing processes that are critical to national defense; security; infrastructure; energy; medical products and other key areas of the U.S. manufacturing base. ""This funding will help move this manufacturing research to a higher level;"" said Dr. Juan Sanchez; the university's vice president for research. ""This is a crucial area of the United States economy and this research could have wide ranging impact on our economy."" Dr. Steve Nichols stated; Manufacturing is often viewed from the standpoint of industrial and mechanical engineering; however; significant advances in manufacturing will take place from the integration of fields such as materials science; electrical engineering; computer sciences and computer engineering. Resulting advanced of flexible manufacturing and de-manufacturing processes developed in this initiative will increase national security in applications such as de-militarization of weapons. In the Continuing Resolution; Congressman Smith also supported inclusion of an additional $2.5 billion to fund and prevent cuts to the Pell Grant program; which provides financial aid to low-income undergraduate and certain graduate students. This has been a big week for UT Austin; as the Cockrell School of Engineering; College of Natural Sciences; and College of Education also learned that they were the recipients of $12.5 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to prepare educators to teach engineering to Texas high-school students. The Defense appropriations funding and the NSF grant speak volumes about UT Austins ability not only to prepare young minds for the challenges of the future; but to contribute to and enhance our nations competitiveness; said Smith.
09.25.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that at his request $1.6 million in Defense appropriations for Albany Engineered Composites was included in the Continuing Resolution spending bill; which was passed by the House of Representatives. The Boerne firm will use the funding for their work on a crucial component of the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Short Take-off and Vertical Landing (STOVL).The Joint Strike Fighter will fill a vital role in our nations defense and our own local engineering expertise is playing a key role in making that happen; said Smith. These federal funds coming to Boerne represent a win-win situation for the military and our economy. Brian Coffenberry; vice president and general manager of Albany Engineered Composites said; These funds will enable Albany to accelerate work that is necessary to meet the cost and schedule targets of the F-35B JSF STOVL fighter aircraft. We believe that this situation is a good example of how industry and government can work together to strengthen our country; our industrial base; and our local community.Albany is working on the lift fan that makes F-35B a STOVL aircraft. The federal funding breakdown is as follows: 54% will be used for engineering labor; 13% for program management; 10% for direct labor; 9% for materials and material testing; and 14% for qualifications testing and customer technical support.
09.25.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that at his request $360;000 from FEMA for the City of New Braunfels Flood Project was included in the Continuing Resolution spending bill; which was passed by the House of Representatives. The funding will be used for planning and engineering to address persistent flooding that affects the ability of emergency services to access the city.These federal funds will directly impact the emergency preparedness efforts of the City of New Braunfels; said Smith. As recent events remind us; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This is a good example of how government at the local and federal levels can work together to identify and solve problems before they become bigger ones. On behalf of the City of New Braunfels; I want to thank Congressman Smith for his hard work to help ensure the safety of our community and the ability of our first responders to do their jobs; said New Braunfels Mayor Bruce Boyer. This funding covers 80% of the cost of the first phase of our flood project; which is money that wont have to come out of the pockets of local taxpayers. The project focuses on two road crossings of Blieders Creek on River Road. Phase one consists of the engineering phase and will cost approximately $450;000. The city is prepared to contribute $90;000. The City has completed preliminary planning and is prepared to begin this phase immediately; with completion expected in 2010. The estimated cost of the full two-phase project is $3.4 million. Estimated completion timeframe for the total project is 18 to 24 months.
09.25.2008	Legislation Funds BRAC Efforts for FY 2009, Includes $236.1 Million in Federal Funding for San Antonio This week, the House of Representatives passed HR 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, by a vote of 370-58. This bipartisan legislation will ensure that government services, even more critical than ever in this time of uncertainty, will continue to work for the American people. This legislation also includes millions of dollars in disaster relief to help the people of Texass Gulf Coast who were hit so hard by Hurricane Ike last weekend, more than 10,000 of whom were received in San Antonio. It also adds an additional $4.1 billion to care for our wounded veterans, part of the tremendous increases in veterans health care funding over the past two years. American servicemen, women and their families are world-class and deserve the finest facilities, support system and healthcare possible, said Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). The federal funding for Camp Bullis, Fort Sam Houston, and Lackland Air Force Base speaks volumes about the contributions of the individuals stationed there and the vital role they play in our national security. The funding also represents a significant investment in the militarys presence in the San Antonio community, which has a multi-billion dollar impact on our local economy, helping to ensure that we will continue to be Military City USA for years to come. Control over spending is one of the major roles assigned to Congress by the Constitution, said Congressman Charles Gonzalez (TX-20), and we owe it all those who serve our country “ the men and women in uniform or recovering under Veterans Administration care, of course, but also the civil servants who work day in and day out on behalf of all of our citizens “ to ensure that we provide adequate funds so that they can do the job we have asked of them. Part of that job includes coming to the aid of areas devastated, as Galveston was, by natural disasters, and I was glad to see that aid included in this bill. Funding military pay raises, BRAC additions and substantive VA programs to San Antonio and elsewhere in my district has been one of my top priorities, said Congressman Ciro Rodriguez (TX-23), because the investments in infrastructure, medical training and health care will play an important role in our community and our military for many years to come. The final version of HR 2638 legislation includes an investment of $40.8 billion in the Veterans Health Administration, $4.1 billion above the level allocated in 2008. The VHA estimates that they will treat more than 5.8 million patients in 2009 including more than 333,275 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. The unprecedented levels of funding in consecutive years represents a strong commitment to American servicemen, women, and their families and clearly demonstrates that Congress will honor all of those who have served our country with the quality services and healthcare that they deserve. Upon its conclusion in 2011, the BRAC investment is expected to fund 4,886 additional personnel and 9,000 additional students in San Antonio; BRACs economic impact is expected to reach $621 million for the San Antonio area upon completion. The local investment of $236.1 million in legislation allocates federal funds for projects across the San Antonio area at Camp Bullis, Fort Sam Houston, and Lackland Air Force Base. They include: · $4.2 million for a live fire shoot house training facility at Camp Bullis · $47 million for Advanced Initiative Training (AIT) barracks, $96 million for trainee barracks, and $13 million for a medical instructional facility at Fort Sam Houston · $75 million for a Basic Military Training (BMT) recruit dormitory and $900,000 for a consolidated security forces operations center at Lackland Air Force Base
09.23.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today applauded the news that the renewal of the 26-year moratorium on offshore and oil shale energy production will be dropped from a stopgap spending bill to fund the federal government, according to House Appropriations Committee Chair David Obey. The American people have spoken and its having an impact, said Smith. This is long overdue, but its a critical first step towards American energy independence. The Democratic majority is finally facing the fact the vast majority of Americans want more American energy. And the majority knows that continued attempts to ignore the will of the people will not be successful. House Republicans have fought for months to lift the outdated bans on American energy production, and the capitulation by Democrats today is a victory for Americans struggling with record gasoline prices. Republicans are pushing for an all of the above energy plan that increases production of American energy in an environmentally-responsible way to help reduce gas prices. Congressional Democrats, lead by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have blocked all such efforts. This is only the beginning of fulfilling the desires of the American People, said Smith. Although the Democratic Majority will allow these bans to expire, they are still blocking debate and a vote on the kind of energy plan favored by two-thirds of Americans. Smith is an original cosponsor of the American Energy Act (H.R. 6566), an all of the above plan to lower gas prices by encouraging more conservation and efficiency, promoting the use of alterative and renewable fuels, and expanding drilling on remote lands and far off American shores in an environmentally-safe way. The bill will create a renewable energy trust fund that would be financed through revenues from drilling from several energy-rich locations in Alaska and far offshore and includes critical revenue-sharing provisions that gives states the incentive to allow such job-creating energy production.
09.18.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith announced today that he is an original cosponsor of H.CON.RES. 417, which calls on Congress to continue working until a comprehensive all of the above energy bill “ as favored by two thirds of the American people “ is enacted into law. Congress is scheduled to adjourn on September 26 and Speaker Pelosi refuses to allow debate and a vote on such legislation. As the American economy continues to be squeezed by high energy and gas prices, Americans demand and strongly support the all of the above energy strategy for which House Republicans are fighting, said Smith. Democrats continue to leave Americas energy crisis unaddressed and House Republicans will continue to push for a full debate and vote on our energy plan: the American Energy Act. The resolution states that the 110th Congress should not adjourn until comprehensive energy legislation has been enacted into law that: · Opens the Outer Continental Shelf, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and oil shale reserves to environmentally-sensitive exploration and extraction. · Extends expiring renewable energy incentives. · Encourages the streamlined approval of new refining capacity and nuclear power facilities. · Encourages advanced research and development of clean coal, coal-to-liquid, and carbon sequestration technologies. · Minimizes drawn out legal challenges that unreasonably delay or prevent actual domestic energy production.
09.17.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today opposed HR 6899 “ the energy bill drafted in secret by the Democratic Majority -- calling it a cynical hoax that claims to open American off-shore oil and gas to development, but actually prohibits exploration of 80 to 85 percent of those vast resources. This Democratic plan will continue to make the United States the only nation in the world that refuses to use its own resources to solve its own problems, said Congressman Smith. Late Monday night, in violation of their own rules allowing 24 hours to review a bill, House Democrats released a 290-page bill that was written by their Leadership behind closed doors without any input from House Republicans. Because of public pressure, Democrats are trying to demonstrate that they are in favor of developing American energy, but their legislation will achieve the opposite. According to CQ Today, Democrats appear to be aiming to bring their bill up for a vote in order to say theyve held a vote on drilling, and then slamming Republicans who vote against it. This not the all of the above energy strategy favored by two-thirds of the American people. The Democratic plan includes: ¢ No environmentally responsible exploration on the Arctic coastal plain in Alaska. The Interior Department estimates the 1002 area contains 10.4 billion barrels of oil. ¢ No expansion of emission-free nuclear power. France relies on nuclear for nearly 80 percent of its electricity needs. The United States, only 20 percent. ¢ No development of advanced clean coal and coal-to-liquid technologies and resources. ¢ The Democratic plan funds investment in renewable energy at the expense of American taxpayers. The Republican plan increases investment in renewables through revenues derived from exploration for American energy. ¢ No real oil shale exploration. The bill discourages environmentally responsible exploration of American oil shale. The Department of Energy estimates that 2 trillion barrels of oil shale exists within the United States. ¢ No new refineries. No provisions to cut red-tape and increase American refining capacity of American made energy. ¢ No lawsuit reform to prevent frivolous lawsuits from radical interest groups intent on stopping the environmentally sound exploration of American energy solely for political purposes. ¢ Tax hikes and price spikes. Despite the fact that Americans are bearing a great economic burden “ including high gas prices and soon, with winter coming, record home heating bills “ the Democratic plan will raise energy taxes and hike electricity prices. The Democratic bill includes $19 billion in energy tax hikes on American consumers, manufacturers and small businesses.
09.12.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith was briefed today by officials from Fort Sam Houston Garrison, FEMA, and U.S. Army North, which helps coordinate emergency preparedness and response efforts at the federal, state and local levels. Congressman Smith then met with District Fire Chief Nim Kidd, Emergency Management Coordinator for San Antonios Office of Emergency Management. After the meeting, Congressman Smith and Chief Kidd visited a first responder shelter at Port San Antonio.
09.09.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith sharply criticized the Democratic Majority today for ignoring the American peoples calls for an all of the above energy plan to help lower gas prices. Rather than allow a vote on such a bill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi instead chose to introduce legislation that will permanently lock up 80 percent of the energy resources located off our shores. Two thirds of Americans favor an 'all of the above' energy plan that includes environmentally-safe drilling for American oil and gas off our coasts, said Smith. Instead, in an effort to run out the clock before Congress adjourns, the Speaker wants to make our nations vast oil and gas reserves off limits at a time when we need them to help reduce the price of fuel and our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. Like most Americans, House Republicans and a number of Democrats favor an all of the above strategy to lower gas prices by increasing production of American energy, promoting more conservation and efficiency, and encouraging the use of alternative and renewable fuels. Smith is an original cosponsor of the American Energy Act (H.R. 6566), which will accomplish that. An editorial in todays USA Today endorses more offshore drilling as a first step in an all of the above approach to reduce prices at the pump “ exactly the approach House Republicans have called for all year. With less than three weeks left in the 110th Congress, Speaker Pelosi refuses to allow a vote on the plan. The Democratic Leadership fears bringing the American Energy Act up for a vote because they know that the American people favor it, Republicans favor it, and members of their own party do too. The Democratic Majority is on the wrong side of the energy issue and rather than face up to it, theyre choosing to avoid it all together.
08.26.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today met with Austin Mayor Will Wynn, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo and Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton to discuss the challenges faced by law enforcement due to high gas prices. Across the country, sky-high fuel costs have squeezed budgets, forcing some police and sheriff departments to cut back on patrols and hiring new officers. Keeping our neighborhoods safe is a tall order even without the very real financial pressure placed on public safety by the high price of gas, said Smith, who is the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee. This illustrates just how pervasive the energy crisis is and underscores the urgent need for a common sense American energy policy to help bring down prices at the pump. In Texas, the budget crunch has affected communities large and small. Last year, the Houston Police Department surpassed its $8.7 million gasoline budget and expects to spend $11.3 million this year. In Boerne, the police department is turning to more fuel efficient police cruisers to help ease the strain. In Austin, the City purchases five million gallons of gas a year for public safety and APD has developed a vehicle pool program to reduce its fleet size. APD also has 128 flex-fuel vehicles and gas-electric hybrids. To be sure, were feeling the pinch of high gas prices in municipal operations “ fortunately, in Austin were a little head of the game, said Austin Mayor Will Wynn. Weve embarked on an aggressive program to increase the fuel efficiency of our fleet and ultimately convert it away from petroleum entirely. In a carbon-constrained economy, we believe this is the conservative approach our taxpayers deserve. The Austin Police Department is committed to efficient use of our resources, and the current rise in energy costs has lead us to further examine savings measures, said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. These measures include the purchase of flex-fuel vehicles and the use of hybrid technology where operationally feasible. We appreciate Congressman Smiths efforts to assist the This week Smith will return to Washington to push for a vote on a comprehensive measure to increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies. We need to have an open debate and vote on energy, said Smith. And while we may not all see eye to eye, government officials should at least agree to take into account public safety concerns when discussing energy solutions.
08.18.2008	According to Congressman Lamar Smith, House Speaker Nancy Pelosis latest energy proposal only masquerades as a comprehensive energy plan and does not take the steps overwhelmingly supported by the American people to free us from dependence on foreign oil. The American people know that in order to solve the energy crisis, it will take an ˜all of the above approach to increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies, said Smith. Yet Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues to block a vote on the very reforms the American people want, and her latest proposal in no different. Recent polls show that more than 75% of Americans favor development of vast American energy resources to help lower gasoline prices and break dependence on foreign oil. In the face of such popular support, Speaker Pelosi remains steadfast in her refusal to allow a vote on the American Energy Act (H.R. 6566) -- House Republicans all of the above bill to lower gas prices. Instead, the Speaker is drafting a plan in secret, and loading it with enough poison pills to ensure its defeat “ including prohibiting expanded energy production far off the coast of California. If the Democratic leaders were serious about increasing production of American energy and lowering the price of gasoline, they would call Congress back into session immediately to vote on the American Energy Act. Smith is an original cosponsor of the American Energy Act. For more information on the comprehensive energy plan, go to https://www.gop.gov/energy/.
08.01.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith this week voted in favor of the Conference Report on the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007, which passed with broad bipartisan support. The legislation, which seeks to make college more affordable and accessible, combines the House and Senate versions of the bill. A secure financial aid system is an essential part of our nations higher education policy and transparency of that system is needed, said Congressman Smith. Higher education must be both accessible and affordable and this bill holds colleges and universities accountable to those paying for an education. The bill creates a Web site where parents and students can go to search, compare and watch college costs. It requires colleges and universities to report reasons for tuition increases and steps taken to correct inefficiencies. The bill also identifies the most and least costly school, as well as those with rising cost increases. As college tuition and fees rise, so does the amount of debt that students are saddled with. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2005, loans accounted for 56 percent of aid in the U.S. and grants accounted for 43 percent. In 2005, 66 percent of aid in Texas came from loans and 33 percent came from grants, including state and institutional grants. Also, Texas public four-year universities costs have risen each year. This means that costs are increasing at a higher rate in Texas compared to the nation. The legislation holds states accountable to ensure that college is affordable for students. It requires that states maintain a level of financial support equal to the average amount of financial aid funding over the past five years. College graduates in the U.S. earn nearly twice as much as those with just a high school degree. So higher education is no longer a luxury --- it is essential, asserted Smith. With state funding for higher education at an all time low, the financial need of our children will only grow in the future.
08.01.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today cosponsored legislation, HR 6763, the Digital Television Coupon Extension Act, to extend the eligibility period of coupons for digital television converter boxes from three months to six months. Consumers can use up to two of the government-issued $40 coupons each toward the purchase of digital converter boxes, which enable analog televisions to receive digital broadcast signals. On February 17, 2009, television stations will transition from analog to digital broadcasting. Due to high demand and, in some cases, limited availability, we learned that three months is not always enough time for American households to find and procure the right digital converter boxes, said Smith. It makes sense to extend the eligibility period so that as many people as possible can find the equipment they need in order to make the digital transition. Digital broadcasting will allow stations to offer improved picture and sound quality and additional channels. For more information on the digital TV transition, go www.dtv.gov.
08.01.2008	Today the House passed HR 6599, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs FY09 Appropriations Bill. The bipartisan legislation builds off of efforts launched last year which resulted in the historic passage of a record increase in veterans funding during FY2008. In addition to allocating critical funds for veterans healthcare, this years spending bill also fully funds the Base Realignment and Closure efforts for FY2009 at $9.1 billion and includes federal funds for projects in San Antonio totaling an investment of $236.1 million. American servicemen, women and their families are world-class and deserve the finest facilities, support system and healthcare possible, said Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). The federal funding for Camp Bullis, Fort Sam Houston, and Lackland Air Force Base speaks volumes about the contributions of the individuals stationed there and the vital role they play in our national security. The funding also represents a significant investment in the militarys presence in the San Antonio community, which has a multi-billion dollar impact on our local economy, helping to ensure that we will continue to be Military City USA for years to come. We owe it to our servicemen and women to implement appropriate policies that honor their service, and this bill is a great example of living up to this responsibility, said Congressman Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20). This legislation will both ensure military strength and readiness, through the strong investment in BRAC and military construction, and take care of our veterans when they return from valiantly serving our country overseas through a sound investment in veterans healthcare, he added. ""This week I held a meeting with the Secretary of the VA and we discussed many important issues in this piece of legislation, said Congressman Rodriguez (TX-23). Funding BRAC additions and substantive VA programs to San Antonio and elsewhere in my district has been one of my top priorities because the investments in infrastructure, medical training and health care will play an important role in our community and our military for many years to come. As a result of BRAC, the San Antonio area economy will continue to make great progress, our country will benefit from the talented professionals that will be trained here, and our military men and women will have the high quality healthcare and support they have earned and deserve. This bill also provides many of the resources that would give the tools to our local officials to prevent encroachment from stopping the great leaps weve made. The FY2009 legislation includes an investment of $40.8 billion in the Veterans Health Administration, $3.9 billion above the level allocated in 2008. The VHA estimates that they will treat more than 5.8 million patients in 2009 including more than 333,275 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. The unprecedented levels of funding in consecutive years represents a strong commitment to American servicemen, women, and their families and clearly demonstrates that Congress will honor all of those who have served our country with the quality services and healthcare that they deserve. Upon its conclusion in 2011, the BRAC investment is expected to fund 4,886 additional personnel and 9,000 additional students in San Antonio; BRACs economic impact is expected to reach $621 million for the San Antonio area upon completion. The local investment of $236.1 million in legislation allocates federal funds for projects across the San Antonio area at Camp Bullis, Fort Sam Houston, and Lackland Air Force Base. They include: $4.2 million for a live fire shoot house training facility at Camp Bullis $47 million for Advanced Initiative Training (AIT) barracks, $96 million for trainee barracks, and $13 million for a medical instructional facility at Fort Sam Houston $75 million for a Basic Military Training (BMT) recruit dormitory and $900,000 for a consolidated security forces operations center at Lackland Air Force Base
07.31.2008	Today Representatives Lamar Smith (TX-21), Ciro Rodriguez (TX-23) and Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20) met with Undersecretary Jay Cohen of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to discuss the potential for a new National Bio Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). San Antonio was selected as one of five finalists for the site out of an initial seventeen proposals. Construction activities for NBAF would result in between 1,300 and 1,614 temporary jobs, generating between $138 million and $183.9 million in labor income and $12.5 million and $24.7 million in state and local taxes. Generally there would be between 250 and 350 employees at the facility. This number includes researchers, technical support and operations specialists with an estimated income between $26.8 million and $30.4 million annually. The proposed NBAF would research high-consequence biological threats involving zoonotic (i.e., transmitted from animals to humans) and foreign animal diseases. It would allow basic research; diagnostic development, testing and validation; advanced countermeasure development; and training for high-consequence livestock diseases. Below are statements from the members of Congress who attended the meeting: Our meeting with Under Secretary Cohen enabled the San Antonio delegation to highlight the many reasons our community is so well-positioned to host the facility, said Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. We have the right mix of resources, expertise, infrastructure, workforce, and community support needed for the NBAF to succeed. Not many cities can compete with that. Congressman Rodriguez (TX-23), a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee, said We believe San Antonio is the best location for this facility for a number of reasons including the infrastructure we offer, the support of the local community, the research facilities we either already have and the enormous potential we have to expand. Ill continue to work with our bipartisan Congressional delegation, state and local officials to do everything we can to bring this world class research facility and its economic impact to San Antonio. As we told Under Secretary Cohen, San Antonio is an ideal location for the proposed facility. Our community has much to offer, including a talented workforce and a strong research and business infrastructure, which would ensure the successful operations of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, said Congressman Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20). This mornings meeting was a great opportunity to make our case to the Under Secretary and Im optimistic that the Department of Homeland Security will quickly realize that San Antonio presents unparalleled resources, he added.
07.30.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today met with New Braunfels High School teacher Cari Gray, who was selected to represent the 21st Congressional District in the House Fellows Program. Gray, who teaches U.S. history, government and economics, was one of 24 teachers invited to Washington, D.C. this summer for an intensive workshop on the history and practice of the House of Representatives. I have long considered teaching to be one of the most honorable professions in America. Teachers have one of the greatest responsibilities -- educating our children, said Smith. I applaud Cari Gray for her dedication to teaching and for the honor of being selected as a House Fellow. New Braunfels and the 21st District should be proud. This year, the House Historian chose the 21st Congressional District as one of the participating districts and Grey was selected in a highly competitive process to represent the District. The House Fellows Program, which is conducted by the Office of the Historian, brings teachers from across the country together to develop lesson plans about the House. Fellows observe the House in session and participate in briefings from the Office of the House Historian, the National Archives, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Library of Congress.
07.30.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today strongly criticized Democratic Majority leaders for their decision to adjourn the House for five weeks rather than hold a vote on the American Energy Act (H.R. 6566). Recent polls show that more than 75% of Americans favor development of vast American energy resources to help lower gasoline prices and break dependence on foreign oil. What does the Democratic Leadership have to fear from bringing the American Energy Act to the floor for a vote%3f asked Smith. I suspect its because they know that the American people favor it, Republicans favor it, and a number of members from their own party do too. The Democratic Majority is on the wrong side of the energy issue and rather than face up to it, they chose to go on vacation. Seventeen Democratic members crossed party lines and joined House Republicans to vote against going home for the summer, but the measure passed by one vote, 213 to 212. This August, many American families will have to choose between putting gas in their cars to go on vacation or putting food on their tables and keeping roofs over their heads, said Smith. I think its shameless that the Democrats who control Congress think Americans should have to wait for a common sense energy policy. Smith is an original cosponsor of the American Energy Act. For more information on a comprehensive measure that will increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies, go to https://www.gop.gov/energy/.
07.28.2008	Today, during a visit to the San Antonio Food Bank, Congressman Lamar Smith urged Congress to act before the August recess to address rising gas and food prices, which squeeze household budgets and force more people to turn to food banks for help. The San Antonio Food Bank has seen the need for its services more than double in the past year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the energy index rose 30% this year and the food index increased 7%, said Smith. This one-two punch impacts all of us, especially families, and I believe Congress needs to have a vote, before we leave in August, on a comprehensive American energy policy that will help bring down prices at the pump and alleviate some of this burden. As the price of gasoline rises, so does the price of food. In the first half of 2008, prices for cereals and bakery products are up 15.5%, meats, poultry, fish and eggs are up 5.2%, dairy is up 5.7%, and fruits and vegetables, 12.1%. The San Antonio Food Bank and the pantries that we serve have seen a steady increase in requests for emergency food assistance “ 66% this year so far, said Eric S. Cooper, executive director of San Antonio Food Bank. Many of those seeking help are working poor and theyre budgets arent stretching as far as they used to. Rising energy prices affect all levels of food production, from fertilizer and harvesting to processing and transporting. These increased costs are directly passed down to the consumer by increasing the price of food. The higher prices are clearly visible in grocery stores and restaurants. For more information on a comprehensive measure that will increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies, go to https://www.gop.gov/energy/.
07.23.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced a total of $610;000 in grants from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to the University of Texas at Austin. The federal funding will support junior faculty development in nuclear engineering and a summer nuclear engineering institute for Texas and Big-12 undergraduates. While both France and Japan are producing close to 80% of their electrical energy from nuclear reactors; the United States is producing less than 20%; said Smith. The time has come for us to increase U.S. nuclear capacity as part of a comprehensive energy policy. UT can and should make a major contribution to these efforts. The NRC; under the Nuclear Education Grant Program; funds grants and other vehicles to institutions of higher education to support courses; studies and training. Smith is an original cosponsor of HR 6566: The American Energy Act “ a comprehensive measure that will increase the supply of American-made energy; improve conservation and efficiency; and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies; including nuclear. House Republicans will push for a vote on the legislation before Congress adjourns for the August recess.
07.23.2008	Today, Congressman Lamar Smith became an original cosponsor of HR 6566: The American Energy Act “ a comprehensive measure that will increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation and efficiency, and promote renewable and alternative energy technologies. House Republicans will push for vote on the legislation before Congress adjourns for the August recess. The American people have spoken and their voice is loud and clear, said Smith. They want Congress to allow the development of American energy sources to help bring down prices at the pump. This bill accomplishes just that. To increase the supply of American-made energy in environmentally sound ways, the legislation will: Open Americas energy-rich deep ocean resources, Arctic coastal plain, and Inter-Mountain West oil shale resources for more environmentally-safe oil and gas exploration, while removing bureaucratic red tape that hinders the construction of new refineries. To improve American energy conservation and efficiency, the legislation will: Provide tax incentives for businesses and families that improve their energy efficiency, including by purchasing more fuel efficient vehicles, while awarding a monetary prize to the first entrepreneur to develop an economically feasible, super-fuel-efficient vehicle (reaching 100 miles-per-gallon). To promote American alternative and renewable energy technologies, the legislation will: o Establish a renewable energy trust fund using revenues generated by exploration in the deep ocean and on the Arctic coastal plain. o Eliminate barriers to the expansion of emission-free nuclear power production. o Permanently extend the tax credit for alternative energy production, including wind, solar and hydrogen. o Repeal the prohibition on government purchasing of alternative energy. o Promote coal-to-liquids technology. Democratic Party leaders should heed the will of the American people and schedule a vote to increase our American energy supply, urged Smith.
07.21.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today met with Josie R. Williams, MD, president of the Texas Medical Association (TMA), to discuss a permanent fix to Medicare physician payments. This comes on the heels of H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, which became law last week thanks to a veto override that Smith supported. The law temporarily prevents a 10.6% cut to physician Medicare payments that were scheduled to take effect July 1. Congress has voted several times to delay the cuts until a more permanent fix to the payment formulas can be enacted. This issue is vitally important to all Medicare patients and their physicians, said Smith. These cuts force doctors who see Medicare patients to pay increasingly more out of pocket, putting them in the unfortunate position of either turning away Medicare patients or going out of business. A permanent fix is sorely needed. Dr. Williams thanked Smith for his support and agreed with the necessity of a permanent fix. I am very thankful and gratified that Congressman Smith and the other members of Congress cast this important vote on behalf of our patients, your constituents, said Williams. Now we must turn our attention to the difficult work of devising a plan to overhaul the faulty funding formulas that have produced these last-minute conflicts year after year. We need a rational Medicare physician payment system that automatically keeps up with the cost of running a practice and is backed by a stable funding source. Smith is a cosponsor of the Ensuring the Future Physician Workforce Act of 2008, which eliminates the current problematic method of physician payment “ the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula-- and replaces it with the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). The MEI is a more accurate measure of the true costs of providing physician services to Medicare beneficiaries and is used by hospitals and skilled nursing facilities.
07.14.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith today issued the following statement on President Bushs announcement that he will lift the executive ban on the exploration of oil and gas in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) far off U.S. shores: Now; the only remaining obstacle to sensible American energy policy is the Democratic Majoritys unwillingness to allow any votes on the issue. Environmentally-responsible deepwater oil and gas exploration can reduce our dependence on foreign oil and ease prices at the pump; yet the majority still refuses to act; even as gas prices continue to skyrocket and household budgets feel the impact. Unlike many of the federal tracts where drilling is currently permitted; Americas OCS is estimated to contain nearly 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; enough oil to replace our OPEC imports for 50 years and enough natural gas to supply U.S. needs for 30 years. Opening up the OCS is an important part of a comprehensive approach to reducing the cost of energy. In the near-term; demonstrating our willingness to develop American energy can immediately affect the oil futures market; lower the speculative cost per barrel of oil; and provide relief at the pump. In the long-term; the energy problem will only be solved through a variety of means; including conservation and promoting the use of alternative energy. Developing American supplies of oil and gas can buy the time we need to advance alternative energy sources and reach energy independence. NOTE: President Bush announced today that he will lift the 1990 presidential directive that orders the Interior Department not to issue oil and gas leases in deep ocean energy zones. Recent public opinion polling shows that two-thirds of Americans support increased; environmentally-safe domestic energy production “ both in deep ocean energy zones and on remote federal lands “ as a chief component of those reforms. With todays announcement by the President; only the Democratic leaders of Congress stand in the way of such exploration to occur in deepwater energy reserves.
06.26.2008	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-Texas) today introduced a resolution to amend the U.S. Constitution to permit the death penalty as a punishment for the rape of a child under the age of twelve. Ranking Member Smith was joined by Congressmen Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Tom Feeney (R-Florida) and Ric Keller (R-Florida) in introducing the resolution. Yesterday, the Supreme Court found the death penalty unconstitutional when administered for the forcible rape of a child, ruling that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The 5-4 decision has generated sharp criticism from politicians and lawmakers across the nation. The Republican Members issued the following statements regarding the Supreme Courts ruling and the proposed amendment: Ranking Member Smith: The forcible rape of a child is one of the most heinous and despicable crimes. States, with the approval of their legislatures, should be able to impose the maximum punishment for a crime that may not constitute murder in the legal sense, but certainly results in the death of youthful innocence and the carefree joys of childhood. This proposed amendment would not mandate the death penalty, but would allow states to choose whether the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for the forcible rape of a child. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and protect Americas most vulnerable victims. Congressman Chabot: The Supreme Court's decision yesterday is a travesty to society. Children look to their parents, family, and to the criminal justice system for protection. What message does it send to our kids that we will put the interests of pedophiles and abusers ahead of the interests of our children%3f It's inexcusable. The constitutional amendment that we are introducing today ensures that those who seek to harm our children in unspeakable ways can receive the ultimate punishment”the death penalty. Congressman Keller: I am deeply concerned with yesterdays Supreme Court decision. That is why I am cosponsoring this constitutional amendment that addresses the Courts shortsighted decision regarding the death penalty and child rape. It is the responsibility of our judicial system to protect the most vulnerable members of our society: children. The aggravated rape of an eight-year-old girl is so heinous that the death penalty is warranted. The proposed amendment (H.J. Res. 96) clarifies what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment. The amendment declares that imposing the death penalty as punishment for the forcible rape of a child under the age of 12 is not cruel and unusual. A constitutional amendment must be approved by two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and then ratified by at least three-fourths of the states in order to become law.
06.26.2008	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Courts decision to overturn the D.C. gun ban and uphold the Second Amendment rights of D.C. residents: Todays decision by the Supreme Court to uphold the right to own handguns for D.C. residents is one of the most important rulings in our lifetime; affirming that the 2nd Amendment is a Constitutional right granted to individuals and not merely members of the militia. Today's ruling finds that as a legal matter; restricting the rights of American citizens to the point where those rights become non-existent or are rendered ineffective; is unconstitutional. This is a resounding victory for the American people and sets a strong precedent that the rights and liberties provided in the Constitution may be regulated but cannot be extinguished by the law. The DC gun ban was originally enacted in the 1970s to try and stem the growing crime rate in the nations capitol. Over 30 years later; gun violence continues to plague the citys residents. By limiting the rights of DC residents; the gun ban has made law abiding citizens easy targets for criminals. Despite the intent of the law; the DC gun ban has made more targets than safe streets.
06.25.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (Texas-21), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, and Congressman John Carter (TX-31), member of the House Appropriations Committee, today announced that $350,000 has been approved for the Austin Police Department. The funding is included as part of the 2009 Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies (CJS) Appropriations bill. Congressmen Smith and Carter issued the following statements: Congressman Smith: I am pleased to announce that the House Appropriations Committee has approved funding to provide new technology to the Austin Police Department. Earlier this month, the FBI released statistics showing that crime in Austin is on the rise. While Chief Acevedo and the men and women of the Austin Police Department are doing an excellent job protecting our community, we must continue to provide them with the appropriate resources to help fight crime and keep Austin safe. Though we have only begun the appropriations process, I will continue to press for resources and funding for the Austin Police Department. Austin is one of the most unique and attractive cities in Texas. If this funding passes the House, it will help to ensure that the citizens of Austin can continue to enjoy our neighborhoods and communities without fear of harm. Congressman Carter: One of my top priorities is providing our city policemen with the tools and resources they need to successfully keep our streets safe. Our local law enforcement agents are the first line of defense against criminals and those that break our laws. It is the responsibility of Congress to provide them with the tools they need to successfully do their jobs. Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo: During these tough economic times, the Austin Police Department is greatly appreciative of the funding that will be provided through the assistance of both Congressmen. It is our commitment to ensure the safety of our community and making sure the City of Austin remains one of the best and safest cities in America. The Austin Police Department will use these funds to purchase and install security cameras in high crime and pedestrian-heavy areas of the city. This funding will improve public safety, allow the city to technologically expand its police force, and assist with criminal prosecutions. This funding is part of the COPS Law Enforcement Technology grant program through the Department of Justice.
06.25.2008	Representatives Lamar Smith (TX-21), Ciro Rodriguez (TX-23), Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20), and Henry Cuellar (TX-28) today announced that they have secured $2.4 million for San Antonio projects from the House Committee on Appropriations. These projects include: $1.4 million for the Mission Reach San Antonio Channel Improvement Project, $523,000 million for the Guadalupe and San Antonio River Basins Project and $500,000 for the Bexar County Solar Project. The Texas Congressmen made the following statements after passage of the bill from the Appropriations Committee: Congressman Smith: Promoting energy and water projects in San Antonio is essential to ensuring that our community stays clean and beautiful. Whether its improving the San Antonio Channel, protecting against flooding through the Guadalupe and San Antonio River Basins Project, or exploring alternative forms of energy, this funding will help promote tourism and drive the local economy. I am especially pleased to have been part of the effort to fund the Bexar County Solar Project, which supports the use of renewable energy while minimizing the impact of vehicle emissions. Though we have only begun the appropriations process, I will continue to press for resources and funding that will benefit the citizens of San Antonio. Congressman Rodriguez: Funding the San Antonio River Authority, as well as additional local energy and water projects, is important to tourism, conservation, the economy and to the way people live their lives every day. As San Antonios area representative on the Appropriations Committee I am pleased to keep fighting for the funding for SARA and other projects so that San Antonio may continue to thrive. Congressman Gonzalez: These investments represent an important first step towards addressing our communitys environmental concerns and furthering our citys economic interests. Specifically, the river restoration and improvement project will pay important dividends across southern San Antonio, and Im proud to have worked with our local and federal delegation to secure appropriate funding. Congressman Cuellar: This is an exciting and necessary development for our constituents. With proper studies of flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration, we can preserve the environment and protect the communities that reside in these areas. I am proud to work with the San Antonio delegation toward this common goal. The bipartisan San Antonio delegation has worked together to include these funds in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. The Mission Reach San Antonio Channel Improvement Project will restore natural riverbank to the southern San Antonio channel. It is administered by the San Antonio River Authority (SARA) and has been championed by San Antonio government and business community. Improvements along the Mission Reach will focus on ecosystem restoration using a technique known as fluvial geomorphology. This technique will transform the straightened river to replicate the original flow of the river while increasing flood control, reducing erosion, re-introducing native vegetation and creating an environment more suitable for recreation and wildlife. The Guadalupe and San Antonio River Basins Project will support studies on flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration, water supply and water quality in Leon Creek, Salado Creek, Alamo Heights, and Cibolo Creek. The studies will help reduce flood damage by identifying risk factors and promoting projects to lessen the loss of life and property. Suzanne Scott, General Manager of the San Antonio River Authority: The funding for this important U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study will help develop a more holistic understanding of several local watersheds. This information will continue to be used to identify flood mitigation projects as well as other water quality and quantity initiatives that will benefit the Bexar County region. The Bexar County Solar Project will promote the use of renewable energy while minimizing the impact of vehicle emissions. The installations of these panels will allow the County to cost-effectively expand our vehicle fleet to include plug-in electric vehicles. This project will help reduce the amount of fuel emissions released into the atmosphere and will help address American dependence on foreign energy sources. Tommy Adkisson, Bexar County Commissioner: This is just one more bullet in our belt of energy independence here in Bexar County and beyond. Clean, renewable and domestic should be the goal for our energy future. The bill will now be head to the House floor for consideration.
06.24.2008	U.S. Representatives Lamar Smith (R-Texas), Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) and Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.) today introduced legislation to stop rogue pharmacies operating on the Internet and protect the safety of consumers who fill legitimate prescriptions online. The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 is a companion to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). The legislation is designed to stop Internet pharmacies that sell controlled substances without a valid prescription. Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee: According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, prescription drugs rank second”only behind marijuana”as Americas drug of choice. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that as many as seven million Americans are addicted to prescription drugs. Unfortunately, online pharmacies make obtaining these highly addictive painkillers virtually effortless, increasing the risk of addiction and death. Congress can and must put a stop to this. This important legislation protects Americans and helps prevent addiction by prohibiting the online sale of controlled substances without a valid prescription. Congressman Bart Stupak: The trend of new rogue sites selling controlled substances is still heading upwards. Hundreds of sites are selling, or offering to sell, controlled substances to almost anybody without a prescription and little action has been taking so far to address the problem. Our legislation will counter this growing trend and ensure all controlled substances purchased on the Internet are legitimate. Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack: With prescription drug abuse affecting millions of Americans across our country, it is abundantly clear that we need to put a stop to illegitimate online pharmacy practices. Deceptive internet pharmacy sites do not even require a valid prescription before sending highly addictive and potentially deadly narcotics to anyone with a computer. The laws currently used to govern this industry are archaic, and I am proud to join with my colleagues in introducing legislation that will help us fight prescription drug abuse and protect the health safety of Americans. Senator Diane Feinstein: In California, an 18-year-old honor student overdosed and died because he was able to buy painkillers online without a physical exam. Unfortunately, he wasnt alone. Statistics show that deaths of young people due to prescription drug overdoses have skyrocketed”up 63 percent between 1999 and 2004. These controlled substances are far too accessible to children and teens on the Internet. We simply cannot allow this to happen. The Senate has passed this legislation. Im hopeful that my colleagues in the House will quickly take up and approve this important bill. A 2004 Government Accountability Office (GAO) study obtained 68 samples of 11 different prescription drugs, each from a different Web site. GAO found that 45 online pharmacies provided a prescription based on their own medical questionnaire or had no prescription requirement at all. Among the drugs GAO obtained without a prescription were those with special safety restrictions and highly addictive narcotic painkillers. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) investigations have discovered 14 deaths or overdoses and 15 persons who have entered rehabilitation or sustained injuries from drugs obtained over the Internet. The tragic case of Ryan Haight is just one example of a rapidly spreading problem. Ryan died at the age of 18 from an overdose of painkillers”including Vicodin”he ordered over the Internet at age 17 without a legitimate prescription. The legislation would amend the Controlled Substances Act to counter the growing sale of controlled substances over the Internet without adequate medical oversight. Specifically, the legislation would: Bar the sale or distribution of all controlled substances (Schedule I, II, III, IV and V drugs) via the Internet without a valid prescription; Require online pharmacists to display information identifying the business, the pharmacists and any physician associated with the website providing the drugs; Clarify that pharmacies that continue to operate outside the law will be governed by the current federal penalties against illegal distributions; Increase the penalties for all illegal distributions of controlled substances classified as Schedule III, IV or V substances; and Create a new federal cause of action that would allow a state attorney general to shut down a rogue site selling controlled substances in any state. The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee. Smith is the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee while Stupak and Bono Mack serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee. The Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security is holding a hearing today entitled Online Pharmacies and the Problem of Internet Drug Abuse.
06.19.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, today joined San Antonio Members of Congress Ciro D. Rodriguez (TX-23) and Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20) to announce the approval of $863 million for the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) plan. Additionally, the three Congressmen announced $28 million for projects at Fort Sam Houston and an expansion of GI Benefits for veteran education under the GI bill. The new BRAC funding is in addition to $7.2 billion previously secured for military bases in the U.S. and around the world. Ranking Member Smith (TX-21): I am pleased to join Congressmen Rodriguez and Gonzalez in announcing that Congress has authorized $863 million for military bases and personnel. I am especially happy to announce that nearly $30 million in BRAC funding has been approved to support projects and improve health care at Fort Sam Houston, which I represent in the 21st District. The brave men and women of our Armed Services sacrifice much to serve their country and keep us safe. This funding will not only help make their lives easier, but also will benefit all citizens of San Antonio by promoting a strong and vibrant economy. Congressman Rodriguez (TX-23): Funding BRAC additions to San Antonio and elsewhere in my district has been a top priority for me because the investments in infrastructure, medical training and health care will play an important role in our community and our military for many years to come. As a result of BRAC, the San Antonio area economy will continue to make great progress, our country will benefit from the talented professionals that will be trained here, and our military men and women will have the high quality healthcare and support they have earned and deserve. Congressman Charlie Gonzales (TX-20): The militarys investment in their BRAC recommendations plays an essential role in their future strength, readiness, and ability to address security threats facing our country. San Antonio has already played a large role in these efforts to date and as a result of BRAC, will continue to do its part in keeping our nation safe and secure through an increased future role. That makes it all the much more important that we secure appropriate BRAC funding annually just like weve done today. Im proud of our commitment to securing BRAC funding, which will pay many dividends locally, through the economic benefits San Antonio will reap courtesy of Fort Sam Houstons role in the entire process, and nationally, by strengthening our military overall and make its operations more efficient. The $863 million are funds that were excluded earlier in 2008 from BRAC. The funding will be part of the emergency supplemental bill to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The BRAC funding will be part of the Military Construction funding for which the bill provides $4.6 billion including $863 million for military hospitals, $396 million for VA hospitals and polytrauma centers, and over $210 million for the military child care centers. Additionally, the House expanded GI Benefits for veteran education to restore the promise of a full, four-year college education and make the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan part of an American economic recovery. Service members will now be able to transfer educational benefits to their spouses and dependents. The GI Bill expansion was included in the $165.4 billion amendment for the Department of Defense covering military costs through the summer of 2009. With this BRAC funding 4,886 additional personnel and 9,000 additional students are expected to be located in San Antonio by 2011. After BRAC is completed in 2011, it is expected that the economic impact will be $621 million for the San Antonio area.
06.19.2008	House and Senate leaders today reached an agreement on legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The proposed legislation modernizes tools and laws governing the surveillance of foreign terrorists and spies and enhances civil liberties protections. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX), an original cosponsor of the bill, issued the following statement regarding todays agreement: ""After months of negotiations and nearly a year of debate, House Democrats have finally decided to put aside partisan politics and prioritize national security. This bill represents a strong compromise between Republicans and Democrats, giving our intelligence officials the tools they need to keep America safe and strengthening civil liberties protections. Additionally, the bill offers communications providers”who assisted the government in the wake of 9-11”essential civil liability protections. Though todays agreement is long overdue, it is an important step for this Congress. Both sides have had to compromise, but we are here today with a strong bill that can pass the House and is supported by the President. Our intelligence officials are on the frontlines of preventing terrorist attacks and protecting against foreign espionage. These tools are necessary to keep America safe. Im pleased to have been a part of this process and look forward to voting for this bill on the House floor.
06.18.2008	The House Judiciary Committee today passed a bill that provides $608 million in federal funding to state and local law enforcement officials to help fight crime and keep communities safe. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne JAG) allocates funds based on state population and crime statistics. The bill will now be scheduled for a vote on the House floor. Ranking Member Lamar Smith voted in support of the bill and issued the following statement: Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to meet with the Chiefs of Police for Austin and San Antonio. During these meetings, we discussed resources local law enforcement officials need to prevent crime and protect our communities. Both Police Chiefs Art Acevedo and William McManus stated that Byrne JAG funds will help them fight crime. This bill is an important way for Congress to support the efforts of local law enforcement officials. I am pleased with todays vote and will continue to promote legislation that helps keep Americas communities safe from crime. Last week, the FBI released its preliminary 2007 Uniform Crime Report, detailing statistics and tracking trends for violent crime nationwide. Despite an overall decrease nationally, some cities still experienced a rise in certain types of crime, including San Antonio and Austin. Byrne JAG funds help supplement the efforts of state and local law enforcement officials nationwide.
06.16.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today met with Police Chief Art Acevedo to discuss recent reports regarding violent crime in Austin. On June 9, the FBI released its Uniform Crime Report (UCR) detailing statistics and tracking trends for violent crime nationwide. Despite an overall decrease nationally, some cities still experienced a rise in crime, including Austin. Congressman Lamar Smith, who represents parts of Austin, issued the following statement regarding his meeting with Police Chief Acevedo: I appreciate Chief Acevedo taking time to meet with me today and discuss recent reports about crime in Austin. We had a productive conversation regarding trends hes seeing in the community, as well as what resources local law enforcement officials need to help keep Austin safe. One of the things well be doing in Washington this week that will have a direct impact on Austin is to reauthorize the Byrne-JAG grants, which provide hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to local law enforcement officials across the country. On Wednesday, the Judiciary Committee is expected to pass the bipartisan bill and send it to the House floor for a vote. We anticipate a significant portion of that funding going to Texas law enforcement agencies. The funding received by the Austin Police Department will directly impact over one million Austin area residents by supplementing current crime fighting efforts. Chief Acevedo is clearly committed to reducing crime and protecting the citizens of Austin. I am confident that through their tireless efforts, the men and women of the Austin Police Department will continue to ensure safe neighborhoods and communities throughout greater Austin. In 2007, Congressman Smith was named Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over issues related to crime, national security, civil liberties, immigration and intellectual property. As the senior Republican on the Committee, Ranking Member Smith oversees hearings and promotes legislation to help prevent violent crime and protect the rights of victims.

06.16.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today met with Police Chief William McManus to discuss recent reports regarding violent crime in San Antonio. On June 9, the FBI released its Uniform Crime Report (UCR) detailing statistics and tracking trends for violent crime nationwide. Despite an overall decrease nationally, some cities still experienced a rise in crime, including San Antonio. Congressman Lamar Smith, who represents parts of San Antonio, issued the following statement regarding his meeting with Police Chief McManus: Chief McManus is dedicated to reducing crime and protecting the citizens of San Antonio. I appreciate the time he spent with me today discussing trends hes seeing in the community, as well as what resources and tools the Department needs to help keep San Antonio safe. I am confident that the tireless efforts of the men and women of the San Antonio Police Department will continue to provide residents in our area with safe neighborhoods and communities. I will continue to promote efforts to combat violent crime nationwide. For example, this week the House Judiciary Committee will vote on bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Byrne-JAG grants, which provide hundreds of millions of dollars to state and local law enforcement officials. A significant portion of that funding is expected to go to Texas law enforcement agencies. The funding received by the San Antonio Police Department will directly impact area residents by supplementing current crime fighting efforts. In 2007, Congressman Smith was named Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over issues related to crime, national security, civil liberties, immigration and intellectual property. As the senior Republican on the Committee, Ranking Member Smith oversees hearings and promotes legislation to help prevent violent crime and protect the rights of victims.

06.12.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today joined other Congressional leaders, policy makers and private sector companies in launching the National Partnership for Safe Computing, an effort to promote better awareness of online safety and cyber security. While the advent of the Internet has revolutionized our everyday lives, it has also created new opportunities for criminals and additional challenges for law enforcement officials, said Congressman Smith. Education and public awareness are critical to preventing online crimes, including the sexual exploitation of children and the theft of personal information. I am pleased to be a part of this important initiative and remain committed to ensuring that all Americans have the resources, tools and information they need to stay safe online. The Partnership demonstrates not only the leadership of the private sector, but also those Members of Congress who have rolled up their sleeves to help Internet users and parents across America take control of their online experiences, said Tim Lordan, Executive Director of the National Partnership for Safe Computing. According to a new Zogby poll on Internet safety, parents are increasingly concerned about the effect of social networking sites on their childrens privacy and are uncertain of where to turn for advice on parenting in the digital age. Of those polled, 72.2% agreed that the Internet”specifically social networking”is eroding younger peoples respect for their own personal privacy. As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Smith is a leading voice in the charge against online crime, cosponsoring legislation to help protect children from online sexual predators and prevent identity theft. Congressional members of the National Partners for Safe Computing include: Representative Melissa Bean (D-IL); Representative Frank Wolf (R-VA); Representative Thelma Drake (R-VA); Representative Mark Kirk (R-IL); Representative Randy Kuhl (R-NY); and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). Private sector partners include: American Library Association; AT&T; Comcast; Common Sense Media; ConnectSafely.com; CyberSmart%21; Federal Trade Commission; GetNetWise; i-SAFE; iKeepSafe; National Cyber Security Alliance; NCTA/Cable in the Classroom; Qwest Communications; TRUSTe; Verizon; and Web Wise Kids.
06.12.2008	In recent years; the Blackberry has been the hottest accessory for Capitol Hill staff and Congressmen. But lately; something new can be found clipped to the belts of Congressman Lamar Smith and his staff members. For the past three weeks; Congressional staffers have not only been checking their email; but their pedometers as well. Thats because Congressman Smiths office is participating in the BlueCross BlueShield Capitol Hill Challenge. The six week contest pits Congressional offices against one another to see who takes the most steps. And so far; Congressman Smiths office is proving that they can walk the walk. They have held the top position for average miles per person since week two when they left fellow Texas Congressman Ralph Halls office in the dust. Congressman Smith praised his office saying; We entered the contest because it promotes a healthy lifestyle and benefits a good cause. But now I think its safe to say that you should not mess with Texas staffers. Were a competitive office and can ˜walk the line with the best of them. The purpose of the contest is to help raise awareness about healthy living. Since the start of the competition; each individual in Congressman Smiths office has walked an average of 144.65 miles; well above the recommended five miles per day by health experts. Its important that our office put our best foot forward when it comes to representing the people of Texas 21. This time we took that literally; said Kristina Harris; who works in the Congressmans office in Washington; D.C. and is Team Captain for the challenge. At the end of the six week challenge; BlueCross BlueShield will make a charitable donation in the name of the winning office.
06.12.2008	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement regarding todays Supreme Court decision to grant foreign terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay the constitutional right to challenge their detention: Todays Supreme Court decision to grant unprecedented rights to foreign terrorists places the American people at risk. Congress carefully crafted procedures by which foreign terrorists”who do not have protections under the Constitution”receive fair and due process. By overturning this Congressionally-approved process, the Court has placed the ˜rights of foreign terrorists over the safety and security of the American people. As part of todays 5-4 ruling, the four dissenting Justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, stated that the Court today struck down as inadequate the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants. The dissenting Justices concluded, All that todays opinion has done is shift responsibility for those sensitive foreign policy and national security decisions from the elected branches to the %5bunelected%5d Federal Judiciary.
06.11.2008	The House Judiciary Committee today approved the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2008, a bill to extend the federal DNA backlog processing program through 2014. Introduced in January 2008, the Debbie Smith Act is sponsored by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI) and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX). The original bill was passed in 2004 as part of the Justice for All Act. Since then, millions of dollars in federal funding have been appropriated under the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program to process the hundreds of thousands of DNA evidence kits across the country. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Smith and Congresswoman Maloney issued the following statements regarding todays Committee vote: Ranking Member Smith: According to the Justice Department, one person is raped in the U.S. every 2.7 minutes. That means 22 Americans become the victims of rape every hour, 528 every day and over 3,600 per week. In addition to strengthening our law enforcement efforts to prevent these devastating crimes, Congress has a responsibility to ensure justice for rape victims and tough sentences for rapists. The Debbie Smith Act protects women by providing federal funding to process the DNA evidence needed to take violent criminals off the streets. Congresswoman Maloney: Passing the original Debbie Smith bill was a huge victory for Debbie Smith, and for the thousands of rape survivors like her. That bill is set to expire soon, but I will not stand by and let rapists roam free while the DNA evidence that could convict them goes unprocessed. Reauthorizing the Debbie Smith Act will ensure we continue to keep criminals off our streets and put them in prison where they belong. I want to thank Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith for their help in moving this important bill forward. The original Debbie Smith Act was authored after rape survivor Debbie Smith testified before the House Government Reform Committee in June 2001 about using DNA evidence to solve rape cases. In 1989, Debbie Smith was raped near her home. For six and a half years, she lived in fear that her attacker would return to kill her. Only on the day that Debbies husband told her that the man who had raped Debbie ”who had been identified because of DNA evidence”was already in prison, was Debbie able to live without fear. A bipartisan coalition of members of Congress, organizations, and crime victims worked together to pass the original Debbie Smith Act. The president signed the bill into law just as police in New York State made their first arrest based the DNA sample of a suspect in a sexual assault case from 1996. The bills authorization is currently set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2009.

06.09.2008	The FBI today released the Unified Crime Report (UCR) detailing statistics and tracking trends for violent crime nationwide. Despite an overall decrease nationally, some cities still experienced a rise in crime. The preliminary 2007 data for Austin shows an increase in all of the reported categories, including overall violent crime, murder, rape, aggravated assault and arson. The most notable increase was for larceny-theft and property crime, which rose by 2,899 and 3,880 respectively. Congressman Lamar Smith, who represents parts of Austin, issued the following statement regarding todays crime report: While I am pleased that violent crime is down nationwide, I am concerned about todays report with regards to crime in Austin. Specifically, the significant increase in violent crime and murder is troubling. Law enforcement officials in our area remain committed to preventing crime and keeping our communities safe and their efforts should be applauded. However, given todays report, it is clear that additional steps need to be taken in order to address the rise in crime. I look forward to meeting with local law enforcement officials in the coming weeks to discuss what additional steps need to be taken to better protect the citizens of Austin. In 2007, Congressman Smith introduced three bills to address violent crime, computer crimes and online sexual predators. In this Congress, Congressman Smith has cosponsored 22 bills to address crime, including legislation to provide reentry programs, improve court security, increase drug trafficking penalties and combat terrorism. Republicans have introduced over 100 bills to help federal, state and local law enforcement officials protect our children and keep our communities safe. To date, only three have been considered by the Democratic Majority.

06.09.2008	The FBI today released the Unified Crime Report (UCR) detailing statistics and tracking trends for violent crime nationwide. Despite an overall decrease nationally, some cities still experienced a rise in crime. The preliminary 2007 data for San Antonio shows an increase in almost all of the reported categories, including murder, forcible rape and robbery. The most notable increase was for larceny-theft and property crime, which rose by 3,292 and 5,522 respectively. San Antonio reported a decrease in overall violent crime, aggravated assault and arson for the same period. Congressman Lamar Smith, who represents parts of San Antonio, issued the following statement regarding todays crime report: While I am pleased that violent crime is down nationwide, I am concerned about todays report with regards to crime in San Antonio. Law enforcement officials in our area remain committed to preventing crime and keeping our communities safe and their efforts should be applauded. However, given todays report, it is clear that federal, state and local officials in San Antonio should come together to determine what additional steps need to be taken in order to address the rise in crime.

06.05.2008	The House of Representatives today passed legislation to expand innovation and research in the field of nanotechnology by a vote of 407-6. In May 2008, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) joined Ranking Member Ralph Hall (R-TX) and Science Committee Chairman Bart Gordon (D-TN) in introducing the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act (H.R. 5940), which strengthens the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) by adding several provisions to encourage nanotechnology education, research and economic development. Congressman Smith issued the following statement regarding todays House vote: The future of nanotechnology is limitless. Whether its medical research, military systems or energy advances, nanotechnology plays a critical role in our lives today and will help drive innovation for tomorrow. Todays vote ensures that American companies have the resources they need to further develop nanotechnology, which will help American businesses remain on the cutting edge of technology and drive the American economy. Dan Holladay, Director of SVTC Strategic Development praised Congresss vote: Nanotechnology is the convergence of 21st century science and technologies. The nanodevices and nanomaterials that emerge from this convergence over the next decade will change the world as we know it today. In nanomaterials, its like rediscovering the periodic table of elements at an atomic level weve only begun to study and combine. These emerging technologies are critical to the U.S. economy and our national defense. I applaud Congress for their vote today in order to help advance nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the science of small devices and structures, as small as one one-hundred-thousandth the diameter of a human hair. It is already being used today in computers, disk drives, homeland security devices and biotechnology. In the near future, a majority of our high-tech hardware will be based on it.
06.04.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today received an award for his dedication to reducing sexual violence and commitment to helping victims of sexual assault. The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) presented Congressman Smith with their annual Crime Fighter Award, which recognizes Congressional support of sexual assault issues, bipartisan efforts and leadership in pursuing legislation. Protecting Americans from the horrors of sexual assault is one of my top priorities and I will continue to promote legislation that provides law enforcement officials with the tools and resources they need to keep our communities safe, Congressman Smith said. Congressman Smith is an original cosponsor of the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2008, a bill to provide federal grants to states to reduce the backlog in processing DNA, particularly from rape and sexual assault cases. In addition to strengthening our law enforcement efforts to prevent these devastating crimes, Congress has a responsibility to ensure justice for rape victims and tough sentences for rapists, continued Smith. The Debbie Smith Act protects women by providing federal funding to process the DNA evidence needed to take violent criminals off the streets. In 2007, Congressman Smith was named Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over issues related to crime, national security, civil liberties and intellectual property. As the senior Republican on the Committee, Ranking Member Smith oversees hearings and promotes legislation to help prevent violent crime and protect the rights of victims. RAINN President and Founder Scott Berkowitz and Vice President of Public Policy Evelyn Fortier presented Congressman Smith with the Crime Fighter Award today in Washington, D.C. RAINN is the nations largest anti-sexual assault organization and has been ranked as one of Americas 100 Best Charities by Worth magazine.

06.04.2008	This week; Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) met with members of the First Baptist Church of Boerne in Washington; D.C. to discuss issues of importance to the church and pray for our nation. Part of a ministry called Pastors Prayer Partners; ten 6th graders and their sponsors from First Baptist Boerne traveled this week to D.C. in order to meet with government leaders and pray about issues facing America today. Congressman Smith: Our nation was founded on a strong belief in freedom of religion. Over two hundred years later; I am encouraged to see young men and women continuing to practice their faith openly both back home in Texas and here in Washington; D.C. I am honored by the opportunity to meet with members of First Baptist Boerne and thank them for their many prayers; both for myself and for the future of our Nation. Pastor Mike Harkrider: Our intent as a group of Congressman Smiths constituents is to give him support through personal prayer and encouragement. We want to bless him for how he has blessed us through representation. He represents us before the House; we want to represent him before God. We bring these 6th graders to teach them early in their life how to do that in following Gods principles. Kendall County Judge Gaylan Schroeder: I am pleased that Pastor Harkrider continues to share his faith with the community and encourages the rest of us to do the same. It is important for all of us to remember the Christian values on which this nation was founded. I think it is great that Pastor Harkrider and these 6th graders are taking their faith to our Nations Capitol. Members of the church who met with Congressman Smith include: Pastor Mike Harkrider; Jennifer Benac; Steve Faseler; Lea Freemyer; Kay Lynn Graves; Linda Hiller; Jason Pratt; Gerald Robinson; Aaron Harrison Wilson III; Kelly Yeary; Joshua Benac; Sierra Faseler; Nathan Freemyer; Mia Hiller; Fisher Koch; Sesily Monday; Sarah Morger; Nathan Pratt; Rachel Ridinger and Annabeth Yeary.
05.21.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted against legislation today that includes a tax increase on hard working Americans. The Energy and Job Creation Act (H.R. 6049) contains $56 billion in tax increases over ten years. The bill does contain some tax cuts but they are simply one-year extensions of current law and will not be permanent. These long term tax hikes would have a major effect on families standard of living, said Congressman Smith. With the increase in gas prices in Texas, coupled with a slowing economy, the last thing those families need is to pay more in taxes. The bill also fails to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT was created to prevent higher-income taxpayers from avoiding taxes altogether through tax credits, deductions and other preferences. However, the exemption levels are not adjusted annually for inflation. ""The AMT needs to be permanently repealed so that it doesnt burden the middle class with undue taxes, said Congressman Smith. This bill fails to address the AMT problem, which unfairly affects more families each year. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this bill also gives $1.5 billion to plaintiffs trial lawyers that will encourage them to bring more and costlier lawsuits. Under the bill, plaintiffs trial lawyers would be able to deduct litigation costs that are currently treated as loans to clients, while other taxpayers entering into similar, or even identical, transactions would not be entitled to a deduction. The bill does contain some worthy provisions such as extending the tax credit for solar and fuel cell property for commercial and residential use through 2014 and creates a new personal or business tax credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles. I will continue to support alternative forms of energy but not at the expense of taxing families more, concluded Smith.
05.20.2008	House Republicans today introduced legislation to put an end to the arbitrary visa lottery system that randomly awards visas to prospective immigrants without considering the overall needs of the American economy. The bill, sponsored by Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX), reallocates the 55,000 annual visas currently awarded by the lottery system to holders of advanced degrees from American universities whose skills in the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics are critically needed by American employers. This is a step toward creating a rational immigration system that uses criteria intended to strengthen our economy for selecting visa recipients, said Representative Issa who is the grandson of immigrants. America spends time and resources educating the brightest minds who come to our universities from abroad. In a global economy, if these educated individuals want the opportunity to become Americans, help our economy in key sectors, and be net contributors to our tax base, we should afford them that opportunity. To remain competitive in a fast-paced, global economy, American businesses must be able to recruit and hire the best and brightest students from American universities, stated Ranking Member Smith. In high-tech industries, those students are often foreign. By reallocating 55,000 annual visas currently awarded at random to foreign students with degrees from American universities, this bill helps keep American businesses competitive globally without hurting the American worker. It is a serious national security threat to be handing out green cards randomly to foreign nationals,"" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte. ""That is why I have introduced legislation for the past 5 years to eliminate the visa lottery program, and that is why I am joining this effort to eliminate the program and put the resulting green cards to a safer use that will actually contribute to our economy. A lottery is by its very nature a gamble”in this case a gamble on our national security, said Rep. Elton Gallegly. I applaud Representative Issa for his leadership in taking the gamble out of our visa system and replacing it with a criteria-based system that benefits the U.S. economy while celebrating Americas diversity. America has the most generous immigration policy in the world, admitting over one million legal immigrants each year. Under the current lottery system, tens of thousands of randomly selected alien applicants win green cards each year. This bill ends the lottery, creating instead a process that provides American employers with uniquely skilled workers without increasing overall immigration levels.
05.08.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) announced today that the Office of the Historian has selected Ms. Cari Gray to participate in the 2008 House Fellows Program. Ms. Gray teaches at New Braunfels High School in New Braunfels; Texas. Ms. Gray is the only teacher selected from the 21st District to participate in a program in Washington; D.C. from July 28th - August 1st. The program will provide teachers with insight into how the House of Representatives functions. I want to congratulate Ms. Gray on this opportunity to learn and observe first hand in Washington; D.C.; said Congressman Lamar Smith. This will be a valuable experience that she can bring back to her students in New Braunfels. This year the House Historian chose the 21st Congressional District as one of the 12 participating Districts and selected one teacher to participate in the program. Fellows will observe the House in session and participate in briefings from the Office of the House Historian; the National Archives; the Smithsonian Institution; and the Library of Congress. Fellows will receive free room and board during the program. During the school year following their participation in the House Fellows Program; each Fellow will have the responsibility to present their experiences and lesson-plans to at least one in-service institute for other teachers of history and government. It is in this way that the House Fellows Program will be able to impact over 10;000 high school teachers; providing an inside account of how the House functions; and energizing thousands of students to become informed and active citizens. I look forward to having the opportunity to meet with Ms. Gray while she is participating in the fellows program; concluded Congressman Smith.
05.08.2008	The U.S. House of Representatives today passed the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property (PRO-IP) Act of 2007 (H.R. 4279) by a vote of 410-11. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Chairman John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI) introduced the PRO-IP Act in December 2007. Ranking Member Smith issued the following statement regarding todays vote: For the past 25 years, intellectual property (IP) industries have been a driving force in the American economy, accounting for over half of all U.S. exports, representing 40 percent of the countrys economic growth and employing 18 million American workers. These industries”including entertainment, high-tech and pharmaceutical companies”rely on strong patent, trademark and copyright protections to preserve their advantage over foreign competitors and remain profitable. Because intellectual property is a valuable asset to both the inventor and American economy as a whole, Congress must ensure that IP enforcement is made a top priority for this and future Administrations. The PRO-IP bill strengthens current laws against counterfeiting and piracy, provides additional resources to key enforcement agencies and mandates a new and unprecedented level of leadership and coordination from the White House. At a time when many Americans are facing a slowing economy and increasing costs of fuel and food, Congress has a clear responsibility to promote policies and legislation that drive American industries and encourage entrepreneurs. Todays House vote is a step in the right direction for IP enforcement and the economy. I urge the Senate to act quickly and make protecting intellectual property a permanent priority. The PRO-IP bill is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerces Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy, which includes more than 500 businesses and associations. The bill was cosponsored by 20 Members of Congress, including IP Subcommittee Chairman Howard Berman (D-CA) and Ranking Member Howard Coble (R-NC).
05.01.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) introduced legislation that would expand innovation and research in the field of nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act (H.R. 5940), strengthens the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) by adding several provisions to encourage nanotechnology education, research and economic development. Nanotechnology exists in peoples everyday lives ranging from the stain-resistant, wrinkle-free pants you wear to the ultraviolet-light blocking sunscreens you use, said Congressman Lamar Smith. This bill will help to stimulate education, research and development of new technology such as detecting chemical, biological, radiological, and explosive agents. Nanotechnology is the science of the very small - devices and structures as small as one one-hundred-thousandth the diameter of a human hair. It is a size scale where the unfamiliar forces of quantum physics take over, enabling marvelous technological feats. Already today, computers and disk drives contain nanotechnology and soon, most computer and telecommunications hardware will be based on it. In the future, nanotechnology will begin to transform biotechnology, medicine, military systems, and energy systems. Nanotechnology is the future of science and information technology, it is small science that can do big things, concluded Smith. Congressman Smith joined Ranking Member Ralph Hall (R-TX), Science Committee Chairman Bart Gordon (D-TN) and others in introducing this bill. Congressman Smith is a senior member of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus.
04.30.2008	The U.S. House of Representatives today passed the Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2007 by a voice vote. The bill makes permanent an antitrust exemption for colleges and universities who award financial aid solely on the basis of demonstrated need. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX)”an original cosponsor of the 2007 bill and the lead sponsor of similar legislation in 1997 and 2001”issued the following statement regarding the House vote: Today, Congress took an important step towards ensuring that all students, regardless of their financial situation, can attend college and reap the benefits of higher education. After over 10 years of working on this important issue, I am happy to see the House once again pass a permanent exemption for colleges and universities who award financial aid solely on the basis of demonstrated need. A strong education is one of the most important gifts we can give our children. A student should not be prevented from attending the college or university of their choice simply because they cannot afford the tuition. Many colleges and universities have funds set aside for precisely this reason. This bill makes sure that no college or university will ever again be prevented from providing financial aid to a student with demonstrable needs simply because of an antitrust law. I applaud the Houses vote and urge the Senate to act quickly and make this exemption permanent. Twenty-seven schools currently utilize this antitrust exemption. Several other colleges, including Yale and Harvard, participate as advisory members of the group. The current exemption, passed in 2001, expires on September 30, 2008. The Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2007 makes the temporary antitrust exemptions passed in 1992, 1994, 1997 and 2001 permanent. It is supported by the American Association of Community Colleges, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the National Association for Independent Colleges and Universities, the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and the Presidents Group.
04.28.2008	The Supreme Court today upheld an Indiana law requiring state voters to present valid photo identification in order to prevent voter fraud. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement regarding the Courts 6-to-3 ruling: The right to vote is one of the most cherished freedoms we hold as Americans. And ensuring the integrity of our voting process is one of the most important roles of state, local and federal governments. Todays ruling reaffirms the role of governments in promoting an honest and fair voting process and upholds the rights of states to pass common-sense laws to prevent voter fraud.
04.24.2008	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Intellectual Property Subcommittee Chairman Howard Berman (D-CA) today introduced legislation to help facilitate the use of orphan works, while protecting the rights of copyright owners. Orphan works are copyrighted materials whose owners cannot be identified or located. The Orphan Works Act of 2008 is also cosponsored by Intellectual Property Subcommittee Ranking Member Howard Coble (R-NC). Millions of copyrighted works are effectively ˜locked up and unable to be enjoyed by the public due to our current copyright system, stated Ranking Member Smith. As a result, investments in new works and expositions by libraries, museums and others are frequently not undertaken due to the possibility of lawsuits and large statutory damage awards. By placing reasonable limitations on liability, while ensuring that owners receive compensation for the use of their works, the Orphan Works Act of 2008 helps reduce uncertainty and encourages creativity. Too many valuable works are unused because their creators are unknown, and potential users fear excessive liability, said Chairman Berman. We must act to lower the legal barriers that keep these works from the public. Ranking Member Smith introduced similar legislation last Congress. The Subcommittee is expected to consider the bill in the coming weeks.
04.09.2008	President Bush today signed into law the Second Chance Act of 2007 to help protect American communities by improving state and local reentry programs. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX), an original cosponsor of the Act, participated in todays signing ceremony and issued the following statement: Public safety is essential to any free society. In order to protect our communities, we must ensure the laws are enforced and criminals are prosecuted. However, we also have an obligation to make sure these individuals are successfully rehabilitated. Approximately 650,000 inmates will be released from state prisons in the next year. In three years, over half of these individuals will be rearrested and return to prison. We need to put a break on this revolving door. Federal assistance is needed to help state and local governments implement programs to ease the transition for offenders and make sure they receive support so they can truly have a second chance to live a law abiding life. Specifically, the Second Chance Act provides grants to state and local governments for employment services, substance abuse treatment, housing, family programming and mentoring. The Second Chance Act is an important step towards ensuring the rehabilitation of criminals so they can become productive members of society.
04.09.2008	The United States Chamber of Commerce today honored Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) with its annual Spirit of Enterprise award for his strong voting record on business issues in Congress. Congressman Smith commented, I have and will continue to support measures that promote economic development. Representative Smith has proven to be an effective ally to the business community, supporting legislation that helps grow the economy and creates new jobs for hardworking Americans, said Tom Donohue, Chamber president and CEO. The Chamber is grateful for Lamars commitment to these important issues and is proud to present him with this award. Congressman Smith holds a cumulative 93% with the Chamber during his tenure in Congress. Senators and Representatives who back the Chamber on at least 70% of their key votes receive the Spirit of Enterprise award. Click here to see Congressman Smith receive the award.
04.08.2008	Ranking Member Lamar Smith today issued the following statement regarding the Congressional Budget Offices (CBO) cost estimate for Representative Shulers Secure America through Verification and Enforcement Act (SAVE Act): The Congressional Budget Offices cost estimate for the SAVE Act is a disappointing distortion of the bills actual savings to American taxpayers. CBO completely ignores the overwhelming cost of welfare programs for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants”who now account for nearly one-in-ten births nationwide. CBO also ignores the cost of illegal immigrants in federal prisons. The most significant cost projected by CBO is reduced tax revenues from employers who will supposedly decide to pay illegal immigrants off the books. CBO assumes that many employers will decide to deliberately violate the law. This is a slap in the face to the large majority of American businesses who want to do the right thing. They want a legal workforce and simply need the tools provided by the Shuler bill to achieve one. CBO should remember that the cost of illegal immigration to American taxpayers is equally significant. American taxpayers are forced to foot the bill for emergency medical care, public education and even prison costs for criminal aliens. Overall, the cost of allowing illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the U.S. far outweighs the estimated costs CBO used in reference to the Shuler bill.
04.01.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement regarding H.Res.1061; recognizing and commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: Dr. King was the leader of an historic nonviolent revolution in the U.S. Over the course of his life; he fought for equal justice and led the nation toward racial harmony. While advancing this great movement; Dr. Kings home was bombed and he was subjected to relentless personal and physical abuse. Despite this violence; Dr. King responded in peace; with strong conviction and sound reason. And as a preacher; Dr. Kings religious beliefs were essential to the success of his nonviolent efforts. It is doubtful that such a long and enduring movement of peace could have survived in the face of such violence without the power of religious inspiration behind it. From 1957 to 1968; Dr. King traveled over six million miles and spoke over 2500 times about justice and equal freedom under the law. During that time; Dr. King led large protests in Birmingham; Alabama; that drew the attention of the world. On August 28; 1963; Dr. King led a peaceful march of 250;000 through the streets of Washington; D.C. And it is here; in this city; where he delivered a speech that spoke for all Americans; regardless of the color of their skin. In his I Have a Dream speech; Dr. King called the march the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. He was right. I have a dream; he said; that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. Dr. King not only lived the American Dream; but he opened that same door of opportunity for millions of Americans. He lived for the causes of justice and equality. On the evening of April 4; 1968; while standing on the balcony of his hotel room in Memphis; Tennessee; Dr. King was assassinated. But a single vicious act could not extinguish Dr. Kings legacy; which endures to this day. And America is a better; freer nation because of it.
03.31.2008	Ranking Member Lamar Smith today issued the following statement regarding H-1B visa reform. On March 14, Ranking Member Smith introduced a bill to address American companies immediate need for high-tech, specialty workers. The Strengthening United States Technology and Innovation Now Act (SUSTAIN Act) raises the annual cap for H-1B visas from 65,000 to 195,000 for 2008 and 2009. The American economy thrives on high-tech companies that require high-tech workers to remain globally competitive. H-1B visas are necessary to ensure that these companies have the resources and workers required to succeed. Tomorrow, the FY 2009 H-1B visas will become available for high-tech companies. Experts expect all 65,000 visas to be exhausted in one day. We have an urgent need to expand the H-1B visa program temporarily in order to ensure that high-tech companies can recruit and hire the most talented and skilled workers in the field. This ˜emergency fix will also give Congress time to address larger policy issues and concerns with the current H-1B program. For example, while raising the cap on H-1B visas is important to remaining competitive in the global economy, Congress must make sure that we do not displace American workers in the process. Congress also must prioritize the needs of American-owned companies over foreign companies. Currently, four out of the top five companies using H-1B visas are foreign-owned. In reforming the H-1B visa program, Congress must place the needs of American-owned companies before those of foreign companies. I am also concerned that only about half of the current H-1B visas made available actually go to information-technology workers. American companies lead the world in developing new technology and high-tech innovation. The SUSTAIN Act helps companies fill immediate needs now, while Congress considers larger reforms to the H-1B visas for the future.
03.28.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has named San Antonio a Solar America City and will award the city $200,000 to advance solar energy technologies. DOE will also provide hands-on assistance to help San Antonio integrate solar technologies into energy planning, zoning and facilities; streamline local regulations and practices that affect solar adoption by residents and businesses; present solar financing options; and promote solar technology among residents and local businesses through outreach, curriculum development, and incentive programs. These projects further President Bushs Advanced Energy Initiative, which seeks to change the way we power our homes, offices and vehicles by increasing the use of clean, renewable technologies. The answer to much of Americas energy needs rises in the east every morning, said Congressman Smith. Solar power is clean, plentiful and has zero emissions and zero waste. I am pleased that San Antonio has been chosen as a leader in the development of solar technologies. Congressman Smith wrote a letter to DOE in January requesting that San Antonio receive the Solar America Cities designation and funding. San Antonio was one of 12 cities selected by DOE for the program. For more information on DOEs Solar America Cities Program, visit www.SolarAmericaCities.energy.gov.
03.25.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) announced today his participation in the U.S. House of Representatives 2008 House Fellows Program for high school teachers. One high school American history and government teacher will be selected from the 21st District to participate in a program in Washington, D.C. from July 28th-August 1st. The program will provide teachers with insight into how the House of Representatives functions. This year the House Historian chose the 21st Congressional District as one of the 12 participating Districts and will select one teacher to participate in the program. Fellows will observe the House in session and participate in briefings from the Office of the House Historian, the National Archives, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Library of Congress. Fellows will receive free room and board during the program. During the school year following their participation in the House Fellows Program, each Fellow will have the responsibility to present their experiences and lesson-plans to at least one in-service institute for other teachers of history and government. It is in this way that the House Fellows Program will be able to impact over 10,000 high school teachers, providing an inside account of how the House functions, and energizing thousands of students to become informed and active citizens. APPLICATION PROCESS Applicants must be employed by a public, private, or parochial school in the 21st congressional district; teach or supervise high school level American history or government. They also must submit a resume, letter of intent stating their desire to participate in the program and provide a one page proposal for a possible lesson plan relevant to the history and practice of the House of Representatives. Applications can be sent via fax (202-226-2931), email (historian@mail.house.gov), or mail by April 1 to the Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives, B-56 Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC, 20515. The Office of the Historian will notify recipients by April 18, 2008. Fellows will receive all lodging and meal expenses during the week. Participants are responsible for all personal travel expenses. For further questions, contact the program coordinator Michael Cronin at the Historian's Office at 202-226-5525.
03.17.2008	Austin and area high school students interested in attending a military service academy are invited to an Academy Day event. Congressman Lamar Smith is co-sponsoring the event with Congressmen Mike Conaway; John Carter; Michael McCaul; Lloyd Doggett; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator John Cornyn. The Academy Day program will feature information about the nomination process involved in securing appointments to the academies. Midshipmen and cadets from the U.S. Naval Academy; Military Academy; Air Force Academy; Coast Guard Academy and Merchant Marine Academy will be on hand to meet with prospective students and their families. In addition; Academy Liaison Officers will be available. Congressional staff members will be at the Academy Day event to assist prospective applicants. Students should start applying in the spring of their junior year of high school to the United States Representative in whose district they reside and to both U.S. Senators from Texas. WHAT: Academy Day WHEN: Sunday; March 30; 2008 2-4p.m. WHERE: Beto Academic Center Lecture Hall; Concordia University; 3400 IH 35 North; Austin; TX CONTACT: Anne Overby; U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith (830-896-0154)
03.14.2008	Ranking Member Lamar Smith today introduced a bill to address American companies immediate need for high-tech, specialty workers. The Strengthening United States Technology and Innovation Now Act (SUSTAIN Act) raises the annual cap for H-1B visas to 195,000 for 2008 and 2009. American employers have an urgent need for highly skilled foreign workers to fill positions in specialty occupations, stated Ranking Member Smith. The American economy thrives on high-tech companies that require high-tech workers to remain globally competitive. H-1B visas are necessary to ensure that these companies have the resources and workers required to succeed. The SUSTAIN Act is an emergency fix that gives Congress and American companies extra time to consider farther reaching changes to the H-1B program, said Smith. Specifically, the Act restores the annual cap on H-1B visas to 195,000 for 2008 and 2009. In 2003, the annual cap dropped to 65,000, far below the level needed for high-tech employers, Smith continued. In fact, this year, the entire supply of 2008 visas was exhausted in the first three days of availability. H-1B visas for 2009 become available on April 1. They are likely to be exhausted almost immediately. When high-tech companies and firms go to American universities to recruit, they seek the best graduates regardless of their nationality, added Smith. In many cases, the best students are foreigners. By denying them positions here in the U.S., we let many talented and highly educated workers take positions with our competitors overseas. That is not good for business and it is not good for the American economy. American companies lead the world in developing new technology and high-tech innovation, concluded Smith. But in order to remain competitive in the fast-pace, global economy, we must be sure to keep attracting and hiring the best workers. The SUSTAIN Act helps companies fill immediate needs now, while Congress considers larger policy goals for the future.
03.11.2008	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today issued the following statement regarding the Democrats ethics resolution that passed the U.S. House of Representatives: The Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement was charged with evaluating whether a new ethics board should be created. I regret that a process that began as a bipartisan one has ended up partisan. Instead; what should have been an exercise in bipartisanship has turned into brinksmanship; and Democratic leadership has pushed a flawed proposal through the House with no opportunity to amend it or to offer an alternative. The fact remains that we would all not be here today if the Houses own Ethics Committee were functioning. I regret that the proposal that passed; by its very nature; abandons the task of reforming the House Ethics Committee and would hamper; not improve the current ethics enforcement process. Americans today rightfully feel the ethics process does not work. They do not know when ethics investigations are started. They do not know the status of those investigations. And they do not know whether a partisan deadlock has resulted in stalling an investigation forever. Americans need this knowledge; and that can only come through reforms to the Ethics Committee itself that will produce more partisanship and greater transparency. But the Democrat proposal does not do that. Instead; it simply adds another layer of bureaucracy on top of an already broken system. It creates an entirely new entity that invites yet more partisanship under undemocratic procedures. Under this resolution; investigations can be initiated by only two out of six board members. If one board member nominated by the Speaker and one board member nominated by the Minority Leader agree to initiate an investigation; but upon further review either board member decides the matter should be dismissed; the investigation can still proceed with the support of only those board members nominated by either the Speaker or Minority Leader. This is undemocratic. To reassure the American people; we need to reform the Ethics Committee itself and require more bipartisanship and more transparency; two goals I thought all Republicans and Democrats would agree upon. ** In January House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Rep. Mike Capuano to chair the Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement. Rep. Lamar Smith serves as the Task Forces Ranking Member. Other members of the bipartisan task force include: Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA); Rep. David Price (D-NC); Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN); Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI); Rep. Dave Hobson (R-OH); and Rep. Todd Tiahrt (R-KS). **
03.05.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement today after House Democrats unveiled their fiscal year (FY) 2009 budget proposal. This FY 2009 budget would raise taxes by $683 billion over five years. That is the largest tax increase in American history and will cost 116 million taxpayers an average tax hike of $1,833. These tax hikes will have a major effect on families standard of living. With the increase in gas prices in Texas, coupled with a slowing economy, the last thing those families need is to pay more in taxes. This is a fiscally irresponsible budget that does not reign in excessive, unnecessary spending. Reckless spending puts an undue burden on those who can least afford it -- hard-working Americans. The budget also does not address fundamental priorities, like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs. This budget does not meet our national, economic and personal security needs and does not address the real problems facing the country.
03.04.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will permanently designate San Antonio International Airport as an Airport of First Landing for private aircraft. The final approval designation was signed by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. It will be sent to the Federal Register today. The effective date has yet to be determined by the Federal Register but is expected within 30 days. This designation will significantly enhance business, commerce and trade relationships throughout Mexico, said Congressman Smith. The City of San Antonio will benefit from this greatly. This is great news for San Antonios general aviation community. I truly appreciate the Congressmans efforts and diligence in seeing this important initiative through to completion, said Mark Webb, Aviation Director for City of San Antonio. In late December 2006, CBP accepted the City of San Antonio's application to permanently designate San Antonio International Airport (SAIA) an ""Airport of First Landing"" (for private aircraft). Permanent designated status will allow private aircraft arriving in the United States from foreign countries to fly directly into San Antonio International Airport and clear customs. Without permanent status, private aircraft were flying into another designated airport before arriving at San Antonio International Airport, which costs time, money and hurts local businesses. The request for permanent port of entry status was made by San Antonio International Airport on December 12, 2006. This designation has been a top priority for the City of San Antonio and local business community. Congressman Smith made telephone calls and sent letters to DHS and CPB to urge them to rule favorable on SAIAs application. ""San Antonio is now positioned to welcome more global visitors to our city, said San Antonio City Manager Sheryl Sculley. ""The Port of Entry permanent designation will positively impact our local economy and we are grateful for the Congressman's dedication to making this great opportunity happen for our city."" Millions of tourists and business travelers visit San Antonio every year traveling through SAIA in private aircrafts, said Smith. With this airport designation status, tourism and economic development will grow expediently. The San Antonio International Airport is located in Congressman Smiths 21st Congressional District.
03.04.2008	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today issued the following statement regarding the Democrats ethics resolution: On February 27th; Majority Leader Steny Hoyer spoke on the House floor stating that Mr. Capuano and I needed the opportunity to discuss the Republican alternative. This discussion has yet to take place. On February 29th; Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a letter stating; To provide the %5balternative%5d Smith plan with the scrutiny it merits; I would propose that the Capuano-Smith committee consider its provision and report to us; as they did with the current proposal for an outside entity. Unfortunately; no meetings to discuss the Republican alternative have occurred. We have two different proposals; but we do not have a bipartisan Ethics Task Force proposal. The Democrats ethics proposal was never voted on by the Task Force; and the Republican members on the Task Force never supported it. We need a unified package that directly reforms the House Ethics Committee. The Republican alternative to fix the Ethics Committee reflects the democratic principles that all Americans cherish and recognize as right and fair: more bipartisanship and more transparency in the current system. The Democrats proposal adds an additional layer of bureaucracy and results in less democracy. I remain hopeful that we can reach a bipartisan consensus on improvements to the congressional ethics process that protects the integrity of the House and increases public confidence in congressional ethics enforcement.
02.26.2008	San Antonio and area high school students interested in attending a military service academy are invited to an Academy Day event. Congressman Lamar Smith is co-sponsoring the event with Congressmen Henry Cuellar; Charles A. Gonzalez; Ciro Rodriguez; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator John Cornyn.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact my Washington D.C. Congressional Office at (202) 225-4236.
02.13.2008	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today issued the following statement regarding the House Democrats failure to pass a 21 day extension of the Protect America Act. The final vote was 191-229. The intelligence community needs a long-term bill to fix gaps in our intelligence laws now, not 21 days from now. The Senate bill rightly addresses the concerns of the intelligence community, while ensuring the protection of civil liberties for all Americans. It is supported by the intelligence community, Senate Democrats and Republicans, many House Democrats and House Republicans. There is simply no good reason for the House Democratic Majority to delay any longer. Instead of bringing up the widely-supported Senate bill, the House Democratic Majority requested more time. But their time is up. The urgent needs of our intelligence community can wait no longer. We have a strong, bipartisan bill that we can and should pass today. The House Democratic Majority must stop playing politics with our national security and pass the Senate bill now.
02.07.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today voted for the College Opportunity and Affordability Act (H.R. 4137). Under the bipartisan bill, colleges and universities have to report reasons for tuition increases and steps they take to correct inefficiencies. The bill also identifies schools that cost the most and least, and schools with the greatest cost increases. A secure financial aid system is an essential part of our nations higher education policy and transparency of that system is needed, said Congressman Smith. Education must be both accessible and affordable and this bill will hold colleges and universities accountable to those paying for an education. The bill creates a Web site where parents and students can go to search, compare and watch college costs. As college tuition and fees increase, so does the amount of debt that students are saddled with. According to the U.S. Department of Education, in 2005, loans accounted for 56 percent of aid in the U.S. and grants accounted for 43 percent. In 2005, 66 percent of aid in Texas came from loans and 33 percent came from grants, including state and institutional grants. Also, Texas public four-year universities costs have risen each year. This means that costs are increasing at a higher rate in Texas compared to the nation. This legislation holds states accountable to ensure college is affordable for students. It requires states to maintain a level of financial support that is equal to the average amount of financial aid funding over the past five years. College graduates in the U.S. earn nearly twice as much as those with just a high school degree so higher education is no longer a luxury --- it is essential, asserted Smith. With state funding for higher education at an all time low, the financial need of our children will only grow in the future.
02.04.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement today after the President submitted his FY 2009 budget request to Congress. The Presidents budget carefully works to restrain spending, reduce the deficit and encourage economic growth. Its time for Congress to grow our economy and balance the budget without raising taxes on families and small businesses. Although the Presidents homeland security budget increases border patrol agents, much more must be done to secure the border. Many of the Administrations initiatives still fall short of enforcing existing law. In fact, real immigration reform would be simply to enforce current immigration laws. The Presidents defense budget represents a strong commitment to winning the broader war on terrorism, improving health care services to our wounded warriors, and providing necessary military construction funding to complete the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements. The Presidents budget rightly prioritizes the needs of our law enforcement and intelligence communities by requesting significant resources to detect and dismantle terrorist cells in the U.S. and monitor terrorist activities overseas. This funding is necessary to protect civil liberties, promote national security and keep America safe. It is important to note that the Presidents budget is a roadmap for Congress as it works to craft a budget resolution and appropriations measures. This is not the final product by any means. Congress has discretion on determining funding levels for government programs. Given that this is the beginning of a yearlong process, we will be working to ensure that important programs receive due attention and are properly funded.
01.28.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statements on President Bushs seventh and final State of the Union address: Iraq: Just a year after announcing an additional surge of troops, Iraq is becoming more secure, stable and democratic. The surge is effective and has produced a safer Iraq. Our troops are still accomplishing missions that will reduce the threat of terrorism around the world. Economic Stimulus Package: The recent slow down of economic growth should not be seen as the country falling into a recession. Contrary to some media coverage, many economic indicators remain stable. The bipartisan economic stimulus package announced last week by House leaders represents a good effort to get money back into the hands of hard-working Americans and their families. Immigration: The President also spoke about efforts the Administration has taken to enforce immigration laws. But much more still must be done to secure the border. First, the Administration must increase worksite enforcement in order to shut down the job magnet that encourages so many to come here illegally and stay. Second, the Department of Homeland Security must implement an exit system to monitor individuals who come here on a legal basis, but choose not to leave. In 1996, Congress established an entry-exit system to ensure that individuals return home when their visas expire. Despite the fact that nearly half of all illegal immigrants actually enter the U.S. legally and overstay their visas, the Administration has still not established an exit system. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: Congress has a responsibility to enact legislation that allows intelligence officials to conduct surveillance on foreign targets without a court order. A U.S. Army intelligence officer in Iraq should not have to contact a federal judge in Washington to monitor the communications of Osama Bin Laden. We know that America is the number one target for terrorist organizations around the globe. Congress must do everything in its power to keep our Country safe from future attacks.
01.23.2008	Congressman Lamar Smith has notified the North Lake Travis Fire and Rescue Department that they have been awarded a $85;500 grant through the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The funds will be used to purchase 18 new self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA) for firefighters. The 51-member North Lake Travis Fire and Rescue serves a 173-square-mile area in North Lake Travis in Travis County. The fire department provides 24-hour protection and maintains more than 1;000 fire hydrants. We have a limited number of SCBAs and went through the grant program to receive this funding; said Fire Chief Raymond Tennison. I urge officials to continue to support funding for fire departments nationwide. This federal grant will help the fire department acquire breathing equipment so they can do their jobs more safely; Smith said. It will enhance their ability to serve residents of Travis County. These firefighters are committed to protecting the lives and property of their neighbors; Smith said. This federal assistance program demonstrates a commitment by the federal government to provide equipment that fire departments like ours need. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered through the Department of Homeland Security Preparedness Directorate Office of Grants and Training and the United States Fire Administration.
01.17.2008	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX), Chairman John Conyers (D-MI) and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) today introduced the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2008 to extend a federal DNA backlog processing program through 2014. The original bill was passed in 2004 as part of the Justice for All Act, which ensured DNA evidence could be used to convict the guilty and free the innocent. Since then, millions of dollars in federal funding have been appropriated under the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program to process the hundreds of thousands of DNA evidence kits across the country. Congress has a responsibility to ensure justice for rape victims and tough sentences for rapists, stated Ranking Member Smith. The Debbie Smith Act helps law enforcement officials identify, apprehend and prosecute rapists by reducing the DNA backlog. Debbie Smiths courageous efforts have brought justice to rape victims nationwide. This important legislation protects women by providing federal funding to process the DNA evidence needed to take violent criminals off the streets. Passing the original Debbie Smith bill was a huge victory for Debbie, and for the thousands of rape survivors like her, said Representative Maloney. Our bill is set to expire soon, but I will not stand by and let rapists roam free while the DNA evidence that could convict them goes unprocessed. Reauthorizing the Debbie Smith Act will ensure we continue to keep rapists off our streets and put them in prison where they belong. The original Debbie Smith Act was authored after rape survivor Debbie Smith testified before the House Government Reform Committee in June 2001 about using DNA evidence to solve rape cases. In 1989, Debbie Smith was raped near her home. For six and a half years, she lived in fear that her attacker would return to kill her. Only on the day that Debbies husband told her that the man who had raped Debbie ”who had been identified because of DNA evidence”was already in prison, was Debbie able to live without fear. A bipartisan coalition of members of Congress, organizations, and crime victims worked together to pass the original Debbie Smith Act. The president signed the bill into law just as police in New York State made their first arrest based the DNA sample of a suspect in a sexual assault case from 1996. The bills authorization is currently set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2009. For more information on the Debbie Smith Act, please visit: https://maloney.house.gov.
01.16.2008	This week Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) delivered six Veterans History Project (VHP) interviews that he has conducted to the Library of Congress. His interviews will be archived as part of the VHP collection and made available to researchers and the general public. Congressman Smith has conducted those six interviews in the 21st District. The interviewees talked with the Congressman for thirty minutes or more about their time in the service, experiences they had, and life after the military. The VHP honors veterans and civilian workers by collecting stories of their service. The VHP, created by Congress in 2000, relies on volunteer efforts to document stories of Americas veterans. By taking part in this project, veterans are contributing to the permanent Veterans History Project collections at the Library of Congress, one of the worlds most respected research and cultural institutions. This project will preserve past memories so that future generations understand what protecting freedom means to these veterans, said Congressman Smith. I am glad to participate in this memorial collection that shows the sacrifices made by all veterans and look forward to conducting additional interviews in the future. There are more than 1.6 million veterans who live in Texas and more than 75,800 of those live in the 21st District. To participate in the VHP please contact the Washington, D.C. Congressional office at (202) 225-4236 or visit the Congressmans Web site at: https://lamarsmith.house.gov/ Texas veterans and volunteers have a wonderful opportunity to record the past and preserve it for future, concluded Smith.

12.19.2007	House Republican members of a bipartisan task force considering another ethics entity besides the Ethics Committee declined to comment on a draft proposal released today by the panels chair; Rep. Michael Capuano (D-MA). The GOP lawmakers; led by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX); say they will review Rep. Capuanos proposal during the upcoming recess and will comment publicly after discussing its provisions with rank and file Republican members. This issue is profoundly important; both to the institution and to individual Members; said Smith; who continued; I remain hopeful that we can reach a bipartisan consensus on improvements to the congressional ethics process that protects the integrity of the House; increases public confidence in congressional ethics enforcement and passes Constitutional muster. The evenly divided; eight member task force was appointed in February by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Leader John Boehner. Task force members include: Rep. Michael Capuano (Chairman); Rep. Lamar Smith (Ranking Member) and Reps. Robert C. Bobby Scott (D-VA); Dave Camp (R-MI); David E. Price (D-NC); David L. Hobson (R-OH); Betty McCollum (D-MN) and Todd Tiahrt (R-KN). ###
12.19.2007	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today introduced legislation to protect American communities from convicted crack offenders. This bill ensures that an estimated 20,000 criminals will not be released before serving their full prison sentence. The American people have the right to know that their homes and communities are safe from dangerous criminals and convicted crack cocaine traffickers, stated Ranking Member Smith. The decision by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to apply lowered penalties for crack cocaine offenders retroactively undermines the efforts of law enforcement officials across the nation and raises serious public safety concerns. Many of these criminals are dangerous repeat offenders who possessed firearms during their crimes, continued Smith. In addition to endangering our communities, allowing the early release of criminals back into society would cripple our reentry programs by overburdening probation officers and flood the courts with additional litigation. To protect the American people and combat the dangerous drug trade, we must ensure that convicted criminals remain behind bars, concluded Smith. This bill keeps communities safe from crack cocaine offenders by prohibiting the early release of 20,000 criminals. Additional members of the House Judiciary Committee joining Ranking Member Smith in sponsoring this bill include Crime Subcommittee Ranking Member Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Representatives Steve Chabot (R-OH), Howard Coble (R-NC), J. Randy Forbes (R-VA), Trent Franks (R-AZ), Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Jim Jordan (R-OH) and F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-WI). In April, the U.S. Sentencing Commission voted to lower penalties for crack cocaine traffickers over objections from many in the law enforcement community including the Justice Department. Last week, the Sentencing Commission voted to make the amendment retroactive, authorizing the early release of nearly 20,000 federal inmates. Because of the Sentencing Commissions decision, approximately 19,500 previously-sentenced crack dealers will likely see their sentences reduced. Of the 19,500 offenders, 35 percent possessed a firearm during their crime and at least 80 percent had previously been convicted of a crime.
12.18.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today voted for the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National (OPEN) Government Act, which improves public access to information by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Congressman Smiths House floor statement follows: I strongly support the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007. This legislation gives the public more information and better insight into the workings of government by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). FOIA performs a vital check and balance on the federal branch. It protects our open system of government and ensures that the government responds to the American people. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining government information is overly burdensome and federal agencies have become less and less responsive to requests for information. This deters citizens from obtaining information to which they are entitled. Taxpayers should have the opportunity to obtain information from the federal government quickly and easily. This legislation contains several provisions similar to those in a bill that I introduced last March. These include provisions regarding recovery of attorneys fees, penalties for agencies that do not comply within the specified FOIA time limits, and additional agency reporting requirements. I am pleased that the bill under consideration today creates a more open government without threatening national security or invading personal privacy. The ability to obtain records from the government is one of the fundamental rights of the American people. When the government closes the doors on information, the people cannot monitor their government. Democracy is based on the peoples right to know. That is why I support the Freedom of Information Act. This bill rightly makes it easier for citizens to get answers to their requests for information.
12.18.2007	The U.S. House of Representatives today approved energy legislation that will increase fuel economy standards and raise the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The Energy Independence and Security Act also requires increased energy efficiency standards for consumer appliances, such as dishwashers, washing machines, refrigerators and freezers, and requires the federal government to substitute energy-efficient lighting for incandescent bulbs. The legislation allows our country to become more energy efficient and less dependent on foreign oil, said Congressman Lamar Smith. Congressman Lamar Smiths SUN Act of 2007 is included in the energy bill. Smiths SUN Act establishes a competitive grant program to encourage state governments and private industry to team up to demonstrate solar technology and apply for federal grants. By encouraging communities to embrace solar energy we can increase demand for solar power, broaden our knowledge of the technology and eventually lower its costs, concluded Smith. The bill also establishes a plug-in electric drive vehicle program to provide grants to state and local governments and other entities to encourage the use of plug-in vehicles. Americans are concerned about high gas prices, our dependence on foreign oil and global warming, said Congressman Smith. Plug-in hybrid cars have the potential to address all three problems. Texas ranks first in the nation in solar resource potential and by 2015, Texas will produce 5,880 megawatts of energy from renewable sources like solar power.
12.05.2007	A bipartisan group of House Judiciary Committee members today introduced legislation to strengthen laws protecting creative and intellectual property, improve federal agency enforcement efforts and provide additional resources to law enforcement officials. Co-sponsored by Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Chairman John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property (PRO IP) Act of 2007 provides law enforcement officials and federal agencies with additional tools to combat the counterfeiting and pirating of intellectual property. Additional House Judiciary Committee cosponsors include Subcommittee on Intellectual Property Chairman Howard Berman (D-CA), Representatives Steve Chabot (R-OH), Tom Feeney (R-FL), Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Ric Keller (R-FL), and Adam Schiff (D-CA). Protecting intellectual property, such as trademarks and copyrights, is critical to preserving a strong American economy, stated Ranking Member Smith. Counterfeiting and pirating intellectual property costs American jobs, reduces American prosperity and threatens the existence of American companies. By protecting intellectual property, this bill preserves American jobs, encourages innovation and helps build a strong American economy. This legislation is an important and necessary step in the fight to maintain our competitive edge in a global marketplace, Chairman Conyers said. By providing additional resources for enforcement of intellectual property, we ensure that innovation and creativity will continue to prosper in our society. American intellectual property industries account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of the countrys economic growth and employ 18 million Americans. The global economic cost of counterfeiting and piracy is estimated at nearly $600 billion per year in lost sales. That is approximately five to seven percent of global trade. The cost of counterfeiting and piracy to the U.S. economy is estimated to be between $200 and $250 billion per year in lost sales and nearly 750,000 jobs. The healthcare industry also faces an increasing problem. According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of counterfeit pharmaceuticals ranges from less than one percent in developed countries to over 30 percent in developing countries. Over 50 percent of counterfeit pharmaceuticals are obtained from illicit websites. The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest estimates that counterfeit drug commerce will grow 13 percent annually through 2010, nearly twice the rate of legitimate pharmaceuticals. Counterfeiting and piracy not only pose serious threats to the American economy, but also to the American consumer, continued Smith. When consumers are given unsafe drugs or unwittingly purchase counterfeit products, their lives are on the line. By strengthening laws against counterfeiting and piracy, this bill takes an important step towards protecting intellectual property and ensuring the safety of American consumers. Specifically, the PRO IP bill: · Strengthens the substantive civil and criminal laws relating to copyright and trademark infringement; · Establishes the Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative (USIPER) to enhance nationwide and international coordination of intellectual property enforcement efforts; · Provides for the appointment of intellectual property officers to work with foreign countries in their efforts to combat counterfeiting and piracy; · Authorizes the creation of a permanent Intellectual Property Division within the Department of Justice to improve law enforcement coordination; and · Gives the Justice Department additional resources to improve intellectual property law enforcement, including local law enforcement grants and additional investigative and prosecutorial personnel.
12.05.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith has announced that the Pipe Creek Volunteer Fire Department will receive a $13;702 grant through the Department of Homeland Securitys Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program. The funds will be used to purchase a monitor nozzle and a large diameter house. The new high volume nozzle will stand on its own and therefore will free up fire fighters for other duties. The 32-member Pipe Creek Volunteer Fire Department serves an 87-square-mile area of southeastern Bandera County; including Pipe Creek. The department has served the people of Pipe Creek and Bandera County for more than 36 years. This federal grant will help the volunteer department acquire equipment so they can do their jobs more safely. Smith said; It will enhance their ability to serve the residents of Bandera County. Right now our community is growing. Weve had limited fire hydrants before and now with the growth and new subdivisions we can effectively use the hydrants and hose to put out fires faster; said Fire Chief Rich Martin. These volunteer firefighters are committed to protecting the lives and property of their neighbors; Smith said. This federal assistance program demonstrates a commitment by the federal government to provide them with equipment that volunteer fire departments like ours need. The Assistance to Firefighters Program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United States Fire Administration. Congressman Smith is a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security.
12.01.2007	U.S. Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21), a senior member of the Texas Congressional Delegation, today hosted an education and federal financial aid workshop. Area students, parents, counselors and teachers interested in learning about the application process for college tuition assistance attended the workshop. It is never too early to start planning for your collegiate future, and the federal government is here to be a resource to you and your family, said Smith. Congressman Smith was joined by representatives from the United States Department of Education and San Antonio Northeast Lakeview College who answered questions about college financial aid programs and offered their expertise. ""Paying for college can sometimes be a challenge,"" said Dr. Eric Reno, Northeast Lakeview College president. ""Workshops like these provide valuable information and resources to assist students, parents, and educators in securing financial assistance for education."" The federal government provides more than $83 billion to help millions of students and families pay for postsecondary education and hundreds of millions of dollars are provided to colleges and universities so that they may better serve their students. Americas most important resource is our children. We cant allow their talent and potential to go untapped, said Smith. These workshops allow students the resources they need to further their education. Click here to view the presentation.

11.16.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) introduced legislation that would create and expand science parks. The Building a Stronger America Act (H.R. 4250), supports the formation and expansion of science parks by creating a $7.5 million competitive grant-planning program and creating a loan guarantee program for the development or upgrading of science parks. This legislation will promote entrepreneurship and job growth, said Congressman Lamar Smith. This bill will help to ensure that the U.S. stays competitive globally in science, education and technology research. Science parks are groups of interrelated companies, trade associations, and universities that together aim to foster research, innovation and entrepreneurship in the areas of technology and science. There are currently about 200 science parks in the North America employing a total of approximately 300,000 people. Also, according to some estimates, every job at a science park generates 2 to 3 additional jobs in the economy. One of the first and most well-known science parks became what we now refer to as Silicon Valley. By combining institutions of research, education, and business, science parks can help create jobs, assist start-up companies and advance technology and innovation, concluded Smith. Congressman Smith along with Rep. Heather Wilson (R-NM), Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) and Rep. John Spratt (D-SC) introduced this bill. Congressman Smith is a senior member of the House Science and Technology Committee.
11.15.2007	The U.S. House of Representatives passed the RESTORE Act of 2007, a Democrat-sponsored bill that overhauls the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The final vote was 227-189. Democrats today failed to protect the American people by ignoring urgent requests from the intelligence community to update tools and modernize laws governing intelligence gathering, stated Ranking Member Smith. The RESTORE Act undermines our national security and increases the risk of a future attack on our country. Democrats are playing politics by claiming that this bill ˜restores checks and balances, continued Smith. But politics should never come before national security. This bill restores nothing but a legal loophole for terrorists and spies. Todays vote comes at the expense of our national security. Contrary to Congresss intent when FISA was originally enacted, this bill requires the government obtain a court order to conduct surveillance of overseas targets, said Smith. The implications of this requirement alone could be catastrophic. The RESTORE Act requires intelligence officials to obtain a court order to conduct surveillance on Osama Bin Laden, but does not require one to conduct surveillance on an illegal immigrant, Smith added. The bill gives terrorists overseas more rights under the law, than individuals inside the U.S. That is simply absurd. This bill does nothing to protect America, nothing to preserve civil liberties and nothing to promote national security, concluded Smith. So what does this bill do%3f It ignores 30 years of precedent in intelligence gathering and panders to special interests groups. Americans would be better served if lawmakers listened to their requests, rather than playing politics with the safety and security of our nation. Republicans introduced a Motion to Recommit that would address three critical concerns in the legislation. First, the current bill requires intelligence officials to obtain a court order to conduct surveillance on Osama Bin Laden, but does not require one for illegal immigrants in the U.S. The Republican motion ensures that the law does not provide greater protections to terrorists than individuals in the U.S., regardless of their legal status. Second, the motion preserves the ability of the intelligence community to conduct surveillance on Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, the Iranian National Guard and other terrorist organizations to protect America from imminent attack. Finally, the motion adds the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a specific terrorist organization. Democrats opposed these common-sense proposals by a vote of 194-222. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard carries out military operations outside of Iran, including insurgent activities in Iraq against U.S. Armed Forces, and is responsible for the export of terrorism to other terrorist organizations in the Middle East. A report released from the International Atomic Energy Agency today found that Iran could be closer to a acquiring a nuclear weapon than previously believed. According to the report, Iran may be as little as a year to 18 months away from having enough uranium to produce a nuclear weapon.
11.15.2007	Chinese spies in the U.S. represent the single greatest threat to U.S. technology, according to a congressional report released today. Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee issued the following statement regarding the report: Espionage poses a very real threat to our national security and economic stability, stated Ranking Member Smith. Todays report confirms what many elected officials and experts have been saying for years”China is actively spying on the U.S. And theyre not just looking for national security information, but also sensitive technology and trade secrets. It has been estimated that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Chinese front companies operating in the U.S. to gather secret or privately-owned information, Smith said. To protect our economy, Congress must enact strong laws to prevent foreign spies from gaining access to sensitive information. Rather than strengthen laws against spies in the U.S., Democrats are poised today to repeal 30 years of intelligence gathering, continued Smith. The RESTORE Act significantly limits our counter-intelligence abilities and creates new opportunities for foreign spies to operate within the U.S. undetected. Protecting sensitive technology, trade secrets and classified information is critical for our national security and economic stability, concluded Smith. Democrats must act now to strengthen laws against espionage and secure our economic future. Earlier this year, Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell testified that China and Russias foreign intelligence services are approaching Cold War levels. In October, Republicans introduced legislation that provides for increased protections against foreign espionage. The Supporting Prosecutions of International Espionage Schemes Act of 2007 (SPIES Act) updates existing laws to provide law enforcement and intelligence officials with better tools to protect sensitive information. The SPIES Act ensures that law enforcement officials can effectively prosecute individuals and companies who violate export laws and engage in acts of espionage. Introduced by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Congressman J. Randy Forbes (R-VA), the SPIES Act reforms existing espionage laws to address outdated statutes, as well as increase criminal penalties for espionage crimes. The Act is cosponsored by Reps. Howard Coble (R-NC), Elton Gallegly (R-CA) and Frank Wolf (R-VA). Additional information about the report can be found at https://www.uscc.gov/
11.14.2007	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Chairman John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI) today introduced legislation to protect personal information, promote data security and prevent cybercrime. The Privacy and Cybercrime Enforcement Act of 2007 strengthens penalties and prosecutions against cybercrime violations and encourages increased cyber security. Criminals have always been able to steal possessions or money, but with access to personal information online, they can literally steal your identity, stated Ranking Member Smith. During the past year, personal records for approximately 73 million people were lost or stolen. By preventing identity theft and promoting cyber security, this bill takes important steps towards ensuring Americans are safe from cybercrime. I would like to thank the bipartisan coalition of Representatives who have joined me in introducing this important legislation, Chairman Conyers said. The Privacy and Cybercrime Enforcement Act of 2007 is a good, bipartisan measure to help combat the growing threat of identity theft and other cyber-crimes. This balanced bill protects the privacy rights of consumers, the interests of business and the legitimate needs of law enforcement. Over 150 million Americans are connected to the Internet and last year alone, spending on the Internet exceeded $102 billion. According to the FBI, the annual loss due to cybercrime is approximately $67.2 billion. Specifically, the FBI estimates that the annual cost of identity theft at $49.3 billion. A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that 21 of 24 federal agencies have significant weaknesses in information security controls, including access controls”which ensure that only authorized individuals can read, alter or delete data”and configuration management controls”which provide assurance that only authorized software programs are used. Last year, a Veterans Affairs Department data analyst took home a laptop computer containing the personal data”including names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth”for over 26.5 million veterans and their spouses. The laptop was stolen in a burglary, jeopardizing the personal information of millions of veterans. Thirty-five states have laws requiring companies or state agencies to disclose security breaches. There is currently no federal law requiring notification of security breaches. The Privacy and Cybercrime Enforcement Act would require appropriate notification to law enforcement agencies.
11.14.2007	House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today joined 154 members of Congress in introducing a bill to prohibit states from issuing drivers licenses to illegal immigrants. The Prevention of Unsafe Licensing Act ensures that only legal residents of the U.S. can obtain drivers licenses and identification documents. According to a recent poll, 69 percent of Americans want to see illegal immigration reduced, stated Ranking Member Smith. Another 77 percent oppose giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants. The American people clearly want their government to secure the borders and enforce immigration laws. They understand that rewarding the 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. only encourages another 12 million to come and stay. By giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants, states are making it easier for illegal immigrants to live and work in the U.S, continued Smith. The policies also raise serious national security concerns. The 9-11 terrorists obtained a total of 28 state-issued identification documents or drivers licenses. Thats why Republicans today introduced a bill that prohibits states from rewarding illegal immigrants with drivers licenses, concluded Smith. An important part of national security means that only legal residents can obtain government-issued identification. By requiring all states to check the legal status of residents before issuing drivers licenses, this bill takes an important step towards securing our nation. In September, New York Democratic Governor Eliot Spitzer announced a plan to allow illegal immigrants to obtain New York drivers licenses. The proposal was sharply criticized across the nation. Despite overwhelming opposition, the proposal still had supporters, including many of the Democratic presidential candidates. Democratic Senator and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton found out the hard way that the American people refused to accept anything but a public denouncement of the proposal. Responding to the public outcry, Governor Spitzer today withdrew his proposal.
11.09.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted against legislation today that includes a tax increase on the middle class. The Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007 (H.R. 3996) increases taxes on families and businesses by extending certain tax credits and deductions and imposing a one year patch on the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The AMT was created to prevent higher-income taxpayers from avoiding taxes altogether through tax credits, deductions and other preferences. However, the exemption levels are not adjusted annually for inflation. As a result, the AMT affects more middle-income families each year. While the AMT patch needs to be extended this bill doesnt fix the problem, said Congressman Smith. ""The AMT needs to be permanently repealed so that it doesnt burden the middle class with undue taxes. This bill does the following: - Increases tax rates for middle-income Americans. - Offsets temporary tax relief with permanent tax increases. - Creates more than $70 billion in permanent tax increases. These tax hikes would have a major effect on families standard of living, said Smith. Our families and our country are better off when government lets people keep more of what they earn. Smith was one of 193 Members of Congress to vote against this legislation that passed the House 216 to 193.
11.08.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that he has obtained $1.2 million to help fund a UT Austin defense project. The funds were included in the Defense Appropriations Bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives. Funding for this project would be used for building a team of researchers at UT Austin who will work with a large number of U.S. corporations to create next generation wireless communication and devices to be used by our military. UT Austin is positioned to lead a world-class program to develop new, innovative military-related technology, said Smith. The unique research capability within UT Austin will provide long term benefit to our nation. I can't thank Congressman Smith enough for the hard work he put in to make this funding available. Over the next few years, wireless networks will become massively broadband, similar to the wired Internet of today, said William Powers, UT Austin President. With these funds, Ted Rappaport and his team at the Cockrell School of Engineering will be able to create the next generation of wireless devices and enhanced protocols designed to use this increased bandwidth. The bill will now head to the Senate floor for consideration and then onto the President.
11.08.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that he has obtained $2.4 million for the Southwest Research Institute. The funds were included in the Defense Appropriations Bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives. Funding for this project would be used to develop clothing to react to rapidly evolving situations when in military combat. Soldiers clothing would include sensors; actuators and computation abilities. These types of protective clothing could detect chemical; biological and other hazards that can potentially harm soldiers; said Smith. This funding would help develop solutions to keep our troops safe. ""Southwest Research Institute is very pleased with Congressman Smith's support of the FIRST program as we look forward to advancing this technology on behalf of our troops; said J.D. Bates; President Southwest Research Institute. This funding will strengthen San Antonios reputation as a community working to assure the most efficient and effective use of our defense resources. This project will improve homeland security; strengthen our military and protect our soldiers; concluded Smith. The bill will now head to the Senate floor for consideration and then onto the President.
11.08.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21); Congressman John Carter (TX“31) and Congressman Michael McCaul (TX“10) today announced that they have obtained $2.4 million to help fund a defense project in Austin. The funds were included in the Defense Appropriations Bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives. The funds would go to Applied Physical Electronics to continue the development of systems and technology to alleviate terrorist roadside bombs. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and vehicle bombs pose threats to our troops overseas each day; emphasized Congressman Smith. This funding would help develop solutions to keep our troops safe; improve homeland security and strengthen our military. It was a privilege for me to work with Mr. Smith and Mr. McCaul to secure this funding that will allow Applied Physical Electronics to continue the development of systems to moderate terrorist activities and enhance our nations defense; Representative Carter said. We must remain committed to providing our military with the tools and resources they need to successfully serve and protect America. I am pleased that the House agreed to provide funding for this vital new technology that promises to protect our troops from hidden mines and allow them to continue doing their jobs; said Congressman McCaul. ""We are extremely pleased with the funding in the 08 defense appropriations conference report and grateful to Congressmen Smith; Carter and McCaul and their staffs for their hard work in making this happen. APE will use this money; in partnership with researchers at the University of Texas at Austin; to advance and field the technology our company is developing to detect and defeat the Improvised Explosive Devices that are killing and injuring so many of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan;"" said Jon Mayes; CEO of Applied Physical Electronics; L.C. The bill will now head to the Senate floor for consideration and then onto the President.
11.06.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) met with Tyler Rush and Alexis Clark who participated in the American Architectural Foundation Redesign Your School Contest. Tyler and Alexis; both from Austin; were in D.C. presenting their redesigns. Tyler was named the grand prize winner and received a $10;000 scholarship. Alexis was named as one of the seven finalists and received a $5;000 scholarship. The AAF Redesign Your School Contest is the largest national design competition open to high school students. Every year; the United States spends billions of dollars building new schools and students are rarely ever asked for their opinion. This contest allows young people to express their creative visions for the schools of the future. College scholarships totaling $45;000 were awarded to Tyler; Alexis and six other finalists. I really appreciate these outstanding students from my district who competed for this honor and award; said Congressman Smith. Schools are the center of a community and the students created a positive learning environment with their designs. The AAF is a national nonprofit organization that seeks to educate individuals and community leaders about the power of architecture to improve lives and transform the places where we live; learn; work; and play. Contests like this allow students to showcase their artistic talent and provide them with real world experience that will help prepare them for a future career; concluded Smith. U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith meets with Austin residents Tyler Rush and Alexis Clark who competed in the American Architectural Foundation Redesign Your School Contest.
11.05.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today supported a National Veterans History Project Week that encourages public participation in the nationwide Veterans History Project (VHP) (H.Res. 770). The VHP honors veterans and civilian workers by collecting stories of their service. The VHP, created by Congress in 2000, relies on volunteer efforts to document stories of Americas veterans. By taking part in this project, veterans are contributing to the permanent Veterans History Project collections at the Library of Congress, one of the worlds most respected research and cultural institutions. The collections are then archived and made available to researchers and the general public. This project will preserve past memories so that future generations understand what protecting freedom means to these veterans, said Congressman Smith. I am glad to participate in this memorial collection that shows the sacrifices made by all veterans. The resolution supports the designation of a National Veterans History Project Week, calls on Americans to interview at least one veteran in their families or communities and encourages local, State, and national organizations to participate in the effort to document, preserve, and honor the service of American wartime veterans. Congressman Smith has conducted five interviews in the 21st District. The interviewees talked with the Congressman for thirty minutes about their time in the service, experiences they had and life after the military. There are more than 1.6 million veterans who live in Texas and more than 75,800 of those live in the 21st District. To participate in the VHP please contact the Washington, D.C. Congressional office at (202) 225-4236 or visit the VHP page on Congressman Smiths Website at: https://lamarsmith.house.gov/ConstituentServices.aspx%3fSection=456. Texas veterans and volunteers have a wonderful opportunity to record the past and preserve it for future,"" concluded Smith.
11.05.2007	The Center for Immigration Studies today issued a report regarding allegations of a farm labor shortage. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith issued the following statement regarding the report: The Center for Immigration Studies report clearly shows that media reports of nationwide farm labor shortages are misguided and false. In fact, production levels for some labor-intensive produce have actually increased over the past five years. During that same time, wages have remained relatively constant. Increased immigration enforcement and border security are necessary for both our national security and economic stability. This report sets the record straight that there is no widespread foreign labor shortage. The full report, entitled Farm Labor Shortages: How Real%3f What Response%3f, is available at https://www.cis.org/articles/2007/back907.html.
10.30.2007	The House today voted to extend the Internet tax moratorium for seven years by a vote of 402-0. The current Internet tax moratorium is scheduled to expire in less than two days. This is the second vote by the House on the Internet tax ban in two weeks. On October 17, the House passed a similar version of the bill that extended the tax moratorium for only four years. By extending the moratorium for seven years, the House is taking a step in the right direction, stated Ranking Member Lamar Smith. However, todays vote does not go far enough in protecting a tax-free Internet. Across the nation, American consumers and businesses support a permanent ban on Internet taxes, continued Smith. A strong majority in Congress also supports a permanent ban on Internet taxes. More than 240 Members have co-sponsored bills that would ban Internet-access taxes for good. Permanently banning taxes on Internet access and e-commerce can only help spur economic growth and encourage progress, said Smith. It would also help keep the cost of Internet-access down, which benefits all Internet users. Todays vote is a temporary win for all Americans, concluded Smith. The tax-man has been delayed for seven more years. But he will come again. And when he does, I hope Congress will be prepared to make the Internet tax ban permanent.
10.29.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) met with constituents who were named finalists in the 2007 Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge. Samantha Gonzalez from Boerne; Danielle Zapata from San Antonio and Matthew Mooney from San Antonio were in Washington; D.C.; this past week to compete in the finals of the competition. The finalists were selected from the 75;000 fifth through eighth grade students who participated in science fairs nationwide. The Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge judges selected 400 semifinalists based on the scientific merit of their work and their ability to communicate the science of their projects. From there; 40 finalists were chosen to come to Washington; D.C. to compete. I really admire these outstanding students from my district who competed for this honor and award; said Congressman Smith. The 21st District had more finalists than any other District in the country. Samantha and Danielles co-project was titled; The Fertilizer Effect on Vegetables and Matthews project was titled; Beyond Geotubes: The Surprising Search for Coastal Erosion Control. While in D.C. they competed in team-based challenges to investigate climate change and environment friendly techniques like recycling. The students were also presented with a range of experiments to test their science skills. The Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge has always been an important part of our companys commitment to science education. There is a real crisis in this country when it comes to scientific proficiency; and Discovery Communications remains steadfast in our mission to advance science literacy and achievement in Americas schools; said David Zaslav; President and CEO; Discovery Communications. This is the ninth year of the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge. Nearly 16;000 students have entered the Young Scientist Challenge since its beginning and winners have received approximately $700;000 in scholarship awards.
10.16.2007	The House today voted to extend the Internet tax moratorium for an additional four years by a vote of 405-2. On November 1, 2007, the current Internet tax moratorium is scheduled to expire. While Im pleased that Congress has extended the ban on Internet taxes, Im disappointed that Democrats once again refused to make the ban permanent, stated Ranking Member Smith. Across the nation, American consumers and businesses support a permanent ban on Internet taxes. But when given the opportunity to support a tax-free Internet, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee refused to listen. Rather than voting to permanently protect the publics tax-free access to the Internet, Judiciary Committee Democrats opposed the measure by a vote of 20-15, said Smith. Even when given the opportunity to merely extend the ban for an additional eight years, Democrats again voted to oppose the extension. In fact, Democrats voted down any and all amendments that would extend the Internet tax ban beyond four years. A strong majority in Congress supports a permanent ban on Internet taxes, added Smith. More than 240 Members have co-sponsored bills that would make the Internet tax ban permanent. A permanent moratorium has broad and bipartisan support. Permanently banning Internet taxes can only help spur economic growth and encourage progress, Smith continued. High-tech and IP industries account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of our economic growth and employ nearly four percent of U.S. workers. Americans want and need a permanent ban on Internet access taxes, concluded Smith. Unfortunately for most Americans, the Democrat leaderships love for the tax man has overcome their common sense.
10.11.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today presented Troy Mann and Leila Stearns with the Humanities Texas Outstanding Teaching of the Humanities Award. The awards are granted annually to Texas teachers to recognize exemplary contributions in teaching; curriculum development and extracurricular programming. Mr. Mann teaches at Spring Branch Middle School in the Comal Independent School District and Ms. Stearns teaches at Redland Oaks Elementary School in the North East Independent School District. Each teacher will receive a $500 cash prize. Both of these teachers exemplify what an outstanding teacher is and I want to congratulate them on this honor and award; said Congressman Smith. I have a great respect for Texas teachers and the invaluable work that they do. I have long considered teaching to be one of the most honorable professions in America. Teachers have one of the greatest responsibilities--that of educating our children. It's certainly an honor to receive such a prestigious award; said Troy Mann; Gifted/Talented teacher; Spring Branch Middle School. Having Congressman Lamar Smith here to present it was certainly a great surprise. It is a great honor to receive the Outstanding Teaching of the Humanities Award. I am but one of a dedicated and dynamic team of Texas educators who work tirelessly educating children to shape our future; said Leila Stearns; Special Education teacher; Redland Oaks Elementary School. These are gifted and inspiring teachers; said Humanities Texas Executive Director Michael L. Gillette. We are pleased to recognize their achievements. Humanities Texas sponsors the Outstanding Teaching of the Humanities Award with financial support from the National Endowment of the Humanities.

10.11.2007	Republicans today announced new legislation that provides for increased protections against foreign espionage. The Supporting Prosecutions of International Espionage Schemes Act of 2007 (SPIES Act) updates existing laws to provide law enforcement and intelligence officials with better tools to protect sensitive information. Introduced by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Congressman J. Randy Forbes (R-VA), the SPIES Act reforms existing espionage laws to address outdated statutes, as well as increase criminal penalties for espionage crimes. The Act is cosponsored by Reps. Howard Coble (R-NC), Elton Gallegly (R-CA) and Frank Wolf (R-VA). Espionage poses a very real threat to our national security and economic stability, stated Ranking Member Smith. As the Director of National Intelligence recently testified, China and Russias foreign intelligence services are approaching Cold War levels. Foreign intelligence operations rely on both legal and illegal means to gather sensitive information, said Smith. It has been estimated that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 Chinese front companies operating in the United States to gather secret or proprietary information. Other countries have been known to use business solicitations, university research and product development, acquisition of American companies, and even attendance at seminars and conventions in order to obtain highly-sensitive and classified information. Circumventing export controls is another way intelligence operations seek to obtain sensitive information, Smith continued. A recent case in Pennsylvania involved the illegal export of components that can be used in nuclear reactors and ballistic missiles to the United American Emirates. The components were ultimately routed to Pakistan. The SPIES Act increases penalties for violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act and improves the coordination among the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, State and Commerce on the enforcement of export controls, added Smith. The act also expands the coverage of espionage laws to include terrorist organizations. Protecting sensitive technology, trade secrets and classified information is critical for our national security and economic stability, concluded Smith. The SPIES Act ensures that law enforcement officials can effectively prosecute individuals and companies who violate export laws and engage in acts of espionage.
10.10.2007	The Judiciary Committee today passed the RESTORE Act of 2007 by a vote of 20-14. Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement regarding the Act: The Democrat leadership calls the RESTORE Act of 2007 a compromise, stated Ranking Member Smith. I could not agree more. The RESTORE Act of 2007 compromises our national security. The Act compromises the ability of our intelligence community to conduct effective investigations, continued Smith. And it compromises the legal protections that allow communications providers to coordinate with law enforcement and intelligence officials on national security investigations. Rather than acknowledge the urgent needs of the intelligence community, the RESTORE Act provides unprecedented constitutional protections to terrorists, spies and other enemies overseas, Smith added. While the Democrats proposal provides additional protections to terrorists and spies, it omits any liability protection for telephone companies and other carriers that assisted the government after 9-11, said Smith. Many federal statutes, including FISA, currently provide litigation protection to communications providers for their compliance with government requests for intelligence information. Failing to provide this protection would result in decreased cooperation with communication providers and an increased risk of bankruptcy for companies who assist law enforcement officials. We have an urgent need to update FISA and close the intelligence gap, concluded Smith. The RESTORE Act ignores well-established practices governing the collection of foreign intelligence information and enhances our enemies ability to carry out deadly plots. This is just another example of how Democrats are unwilling to enact smart, bipartisan legislation that strengthens national security.
10.10.2007	The Judiciary Committee today refused to make the Internet Tax Ban permanent by a vote of 20-15. Instead, the Committee passed a four year extension of the moratorium. Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) issued the following statement urging Congress to make the Internet Tax Ban permanent: The Internet is the single most important resource for businesses and consumers today, stated Ranking Member Smith. In twenty years, it has revolutionized the way we communicate, the way our children learn and the way we conduct business. On November 1, 2007, the Internet tax moratorium will expire, said Smith. If Congress doesnt act now, Americans could face taxes of up to 20 percent for simply accessing the Internet. Thats the equivalent of taxing a shopper at the local mall 20 percent for just walking through the doors. A tax-free Internet is not just good for the American people, its good for American businesses, added Smith. High-tech and IP industries account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of our economic growth and employ nearly four percent of U.S. workers. Todays vote is a litmus test on whether this Congress will support the high tech and IP industries by making the Internet tax ban permanent. Todays vote simply delays taxation on Internet access with another extension, concluded Smith. That just isnt good enough. Congress must act now and make the tax ban permanent.
10.02.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the growing problem of gang violence in the United States: According to a recent report by the FBI, violent crime in the U.S. is on the rise, stated Ranking Member Smith. Neighborhoods and communities that were once safe have become increasingly vulnerable as violent street gangs expand their networks into smaller suburban areas. Since becoming the majority last January, Democrats have held 14 politically motivated hearings and markups on White House personnel matters, said Smith. In the same period, they held only one hearing on violent crime. Todays subcommittee hearing is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. The Justice Department estimates that there are currently over 25,000 gangs operating in more than 3,000 counties in the U.S., Smith continued. According to the latest available National Youth Gang Survey, there are approximately 850,000 gang members on the streets and in our communities. Thats equivalent to the total number of active duty U.S. Navy and Army personnel. In fact, if the criminal gang members in the U.S. were a military force located in another country, they would compromise the sixth largest military in the world in terms of soldiers. In July, Republicans introduced comprehensive legislation to help law enforcement officials fight crime, but Democrats have been slow to act on the bills, Smith added. Violent street gangs cannot be allowed to continue trafficking drugs, recruiting our youth and endangering our communities. Its time for Democrats to stop the political circus and start passing strong legislation that helps law enforcement, concluded Smith. Its time to pass Republican legislation that provides law enforcement the tools necessary to combat violent crime and help keep our neighborhoods and communities safe. Republicans introduced the following legislation to strengthen law enforcement and decrease crime: Fighting Violent Crime: o Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA)”Violent Crime Prevention and Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3142) o Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA)”Death to Cop Killers Act of 2007 (H.R. 3153) o Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL)”State and Local Criminal Laboratory Enhancement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3151) Addressing Gang Violence: o Rep. Ric Keller (R-FL)”Anti-Gang Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3150) o Rep. Charles Dent (R-PA)”Anti-Gang Task Force Act of 2007 (H.R. 3152) Preventing Terrorism and Promoting National Security: o Rep. Geoff Davis (R-KY)”Combating Terrorism Financing Act of 2007 (H.R. 3146) o Rep. Heather Wilson (R-NM)”Counter-Terrorism and National Security Act of 2007 (H.R. 3146) Protecting Children: o Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)”Sex Offender Internet Prohibition Act of 2007 (H.R. 3144) o Rep. Jon Porter (R-NV)”Protecting Americas Children Act of 2007 (H.R. 3149) o Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (R-CO)”Child Pornography Elimination Act of 2007 (H.R. 3148) Stopping Meth Traffickers: o Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE)”Methamphetamine Kingpin Elimination Act of 2007 (H.R. 3143) Guarding Against Criminal Aliens and Smugglers: o Rep. Thelma Drake (R-VA)”Prohibition Against Criminal Alien Re-entry Act of 2007 (H.R. 3145) o Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN)”Alien Smuggling Criminal Enterprise Deterrence Act of 2007 (H.R. 3154) Protecting Intellectual Property: o Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH)”Intellectual Property Enhanced Criminal Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3155) Representatives Smith and Forbes also introduced the Violent Crime Control Act of 2007 (H.R. 3156), an omnibus crime bill that provides tools needed to reduce violent crime, protect the country from terrorist attacks, dismantle dangerous street gangs, apprehend sex offenders who prey on our children, compensate victims of crime and shut down illegal money laundering operations. The bill includes specific proposals made by the Justice Department to reduce violent crime and terrorism, and incorporates proposals by Ranking Member Smith, Crime Subcommittee Ranking Member Forbes, former California Attorney General Dan Lungren, and Representatives Steve Chabot and Louie Gohmert.
09.27.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today announced that he has redesigned his office website. The website can still be found at, https://lamarsmith.house.gov. I hope that constituents find the new site user-friendly and informative, said Congressman Smith. The new design will make it a one stop source to better serve the people in my District. One new feature is an online Washington, D.C., tour request form. Constituents of the 21st District who are visiting Washington D.C. can now go online and request passes for up to seven tours in D.C. Another feature is dedicated to counties in the 21st District. Each county served by Congressman Smith has its own dedicated section with information about local cities, tourist attractions and chambers of commerce. The Veterans History Project (VHP) is also featured on the updated website. Congressman Smith has been involved in this project since July. The VHP honors veterans and civilian workers by collecting stories of their service. For more information on the project or to volunteer please visit the website. This new website better enables me to stay in touch with constituents. And it gives my constituents a way to stay up to date on my work in Congress, concluded Smith.
09.26.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) has announced that SafePlace; in Austin; has been awarded a $700;000 grant through the Department of Justice. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the Department of Justice. The funds will be used to improve support for victim assistance; disability services and adult and child protective services. This funding will enable SafePlace to identify and serve crime victims with disabilities; and hold their offenders accountable through increased reporting. Sexual and domestic violence not only affects families but the community as a whole; said Smith. These funds will allow this great organization the ability to study and understand crime victims with disabilities. ""For years; SafePlace has served many people with disabilities who were victims of sexual and domestic violence at extraordinarily high rates; said Julia Spann; Executive Director; SafePlace. Therefore; we purposefully set about to study and understand the intersection between the disabilities and victimization fields. Our goal was to respond to the phenomenon and we are honored that our efforts have been recognition nationally and that we can now share our expertise to help other organizations follow in our footsteps; said Spann. The bottom line is for more of us to know how to better serve people with disabilities who are victims of intimate crimes. In 2006; SafePlace more than doubled the number of counseling support groups offered and more than 1;000 adults and 190 children received individual and group counseling. I can't think of a better place that helps the residents of Travis County deal with the devastating effects of domestic violence; concluded Ranking Member Smith. SafePlace; the result of the merger of two trailblazers in the domestic and sexual violence fields; has been a presence in the community since 1974. SafePlace offers services including a 24-hour hotline; 100 bed shelter for battered adults and children; and in-court support for those involved in the legal system.

09.25.2007	The House of Representatives today passed the Stop Aids in Prison Act of 2007 by a voice vote. The bill requires the FBI to test all federal prison inmates for HIV upon entering prison and prior to release. Congressman Lamar Smith, Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee, made the following statement on the House floor supporting the legislation: The incidence of HIV and Aids in federal and state prison populations is difficult to measure because not all federal and state inmates are routinely tested, stated Ranking Member Smith. According to the Justice Department, nearly two percent of state prison inmates and over one percent of federal inmates are known to be infected with HIV. Requiring federal inmates to be tested when they enter and leave prison is just good common sense, said Smith. This reasonable requirement will enable prison officials to reduce the occurrence of HIV among inmates and provide much-needed counseling, prevention and health care services for inmates. I believe in tough punishment for criminal offenders because the public deserves to be protected, concluded Smith. But tough punishment includes humane rehabilitation. We have a duty to treat prisoners humanely. To me, preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS among prisoners is an essential aspect of humane treatment and rehabilitation. It is important that prisoners are tested shortly before release into the community so that services can be coordinated for the prisoner and to protect the community, concluded Smith.
09.20.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) has issued the following statement as he joins Republican leaders in signing a petition in the House to call for increased public disclosure of all taxpayer-funded earmarks: By requiring public disclosure of earmarks we will deter wrongful behavior and give the public a better view of what their elected officials are doing in Washington. Not all spending requests are bad. Many of them fund legitimate public projects. But under the Democrat majoritys rules; Members of Congress are unable to force a debate and vote on earmarks in any tax or authorizing bill that comes to the House floor. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse; and Members of Congress are often in a better position to determine the priorities of their districts than government employees in Washington. However; the often secret process that has been used in recent months to fund earmarks has led to wasteful and unnecessary spending. The earmark process needs more sunshine on it; and this petition calls for that. This petition calls for greater transparency to the legislative process; ensuring that Members of Congress are held accountable for their requests. Full disclosure of taxpayer-funded earmarks will enable our constituents to decide whether spending requests are justified and whether they serve the public interest. NOTE: If a discharge petition receives 217 signatures “ a majority of the Houses current total membership “ House rules require the Democrats to bring the resolution to the floor for an up-or-down vote. The resolution (H.Res. 479) would ensure all taxpayer-funded earmarks in all congressional bills will be publicly disclosed and subject to challenge and open debate on the House floor.
09.20.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith has announced Trinity University has been awarded a $219,703 Ronald McNair Trio Grant. The funds will be used to assist and outreach to students from disadvantaged backgrounds as they progress through their education. The grants are awarded through the Department of Education. This federal award will provide underprivileged students the opportunity to receive a great education, Smith said. More than 2,600 students attend Trinity University, which offers 37 majors and 13 interdisciplinary minors. This is a proud for day for Trinity. Trinity has the opportunity to do what it does best and that is to educate our students not only for the time they are here but to prepare them for the future, said Wilson Terrell Jr., assistant professor of engineering science, and co-author of the proposal for the Trinity McNair Achievement Program. This grant will allow us to continue to target a segment of the population that does not have the opportunity afforded to many others. This federal assistance demonstrates a commitment by the federal government to provide universities with needed funds to promote worthy programs, Smith concluded. Dr. Terrell noted that Trinity faculty members, staff, and administrators collaborated on the proposal. That shows the strength of our campus and our University, he said. Trinity University is really blessed to have this opportunity. The Federal TRIO Program includes six outreach and support programs targeted to serve and assist low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities in progressing through the academic pipeline from middle school to graduate programs.
09.18.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the modernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA): In the 30 years since Congress enacted FISA, telecommunications technology has dramatically changed, stated Ranking Member Smith. As a result, intelligence officials cannot gather all of the essential information needed to prevent attacks against America and acts of espionage. We are a nation at war with foreign terrorists who continue to plot deadly attacks, said Smith. But terrorism is not the only threat we face. Our intelligence officials must have updated tools to detect and disrupt the activities of ˜sleeper cells and agents of a foreign power operating within the U.S. Espionage is not just the stuff of Hollywood or James Bond, Smith continued. Spies operating within the U.S. pose a very real threat to our national security and economic stability. Congress must update the laws that govern our intelligence activities to protect our national secrets and prevent future attacks. Nearly 60 percent of Americans polled on the subject of FISA reform support the legislation passed before August recess, added Smith. Yet 90 percent of the Democrats voted to deny the Director of National Intelligence the tools he needs to prevent future terrorist attacks and acts of espionage. These reforms are long overdue, concluded Smith. Democrats should listen to the needs of our intelligence community and respond quickly with resources, strong legislation and continued support for the critical, and often dangerous, service that intelligence officials provide to our country.
09.17.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ranking Member for the Judiciary Committee today issued the following statement regarding the nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States: I commend President Bush for selecting Michael B. Mukasey to be the 81st Attorney General of the United States, stated Ranking Member Smith. Mr. Mukaseys extensive legal service as a federal judge and Assistant United States Attorney make him an ideal candidate for the top position at the U.S. Department of Justice. With over 20 years experience in the federal judicial system, Mr. Mukasey brings a wealth of knowledge to the Office of the Attorney General, said Smith. His experience in national security law is especially important as law enforcement and intelligence officials continue the fight to protect our Nation from future attacks. For the past nine months, Democrats have focused their efforts on attacking the Department of Justice and its officials with politically motivated investigations, Smith continued. Despite the lack of any evidence of wrongdoing, Democrats have held the Justice Department hostage, inflicting irreparable damage on the federal criminal justice system. It is time for Democrats to stop hindering the Justice Department and start working for the American people, Smith concluded. They must act now and confirm Michael Mukasey as Attorney General of the United States.
09.17.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee today raised grave concerns about the European Unions most recent decision regarding Microsoft. I am concerned that the decision seriously undermines international antitrust comity, stated Smith. These issues were hashed out at length in American courts and settled. The EU is sending a signal to antitrust agencies in other countries that its open season on Americas technology leaders, Smith continued. We do not know which American company will be next. The way to prosperity is through innovation, not regulation. I am pleased that the Department of Justice has expressed its concerns about the decision, and I hope that it will continue to pursue this matter, concluded Smith. Economic protectionism in the guise of antitrust enforcement is the road to stagnation.
09.12.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) has announced that the Austin Police Department has been awarded a $4.79 million grant through Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the Department of Justice. The funds will be used to support technological projects aimed at facilitating the sharing of information local or statewide to increase public safety. The grants are through the 2007 COPS Technology Program. These funds will allow the Austin Police Department to communicate; share information and coordinate during emergencies; said Smith. New technology will help our police officers as they put their lives on the line to keep our neighborhoods and communities safe. Technology is a critical tool in Law enforcement; said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo. With these technology funds; APD resources can be utilized more efficiently and will allow us to enhance our on going mission of keeping the citizens of Austin safe. This is particularly good news because Austin is one of only three Texas communities to receive COPS funding; concluded Ranking Member Smith. The COPS Office is a federal agency responsible for advancing community policing nationwide and supporting state; local; and tribal law enforcement agencies. To learn more about these grants; visit www.cops.usdoj.gov.
09.11.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) has announced that the San Antonio Police Department has been awarded a $6 million grant through Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the Department of Justice. The funds will be used to support technological projects aimed at facilitating the sharing of information local or statewide to increase public safety. The grants are through the 2007 COPS Technology Program. These funds will allow the San Antonio Police Department to communicate; share information and coordinate during emergencies; said Smith. New technology will help our police officers as they put their lives on the line to keep our neighborhoods and communities safe. Six million will go a long way in helping the City of San Antonio and the San Antonio Police Department in addressing our technological needs. Were grateful to Congressman Smith for his work in helping us win the COPS grant; said San Antonio Police Chief William McManus. This is particularly good news because San Antonio is one of only three Texas communities to receive COPS funding; concluded Ranking Member Smith. The COPS Office is a federal agency responsible for advancing community policing nationwide and supporting state; local; and tribal law enforcement agencies. To learn more about these grants; visit www.cops.usdoj.gov.
09.07.2007	The U.S. House of Representatives today passed Ranking Member Lamar Smiths (R-TX) Patent Reform Act of 2007 (H.R. 1908) by a vote of 220-175. The bill represents the most significant update to patent law since the 1952 Act was written. Today the House voted to pass important reforms to the patent system, updating current law to better protect the rights of inventors and preserve the strength of the American economy, stated Ranking Member Smith. Few issues are as important to the economic strength of the United States as our ability to create and protect intellectual property, said Smith. American IP industries account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of the countrys economic growth and employ 18 million Americans. Whether its a mouse trap in your home or an iPod in your hand, intellectual property plays a critical role in our day-to-day lives and the global economy, Smith continued. And while IP industries have soared into the 21st Century, patent law has remained virtually unchanged since the 1950s. The Patent Reform Act of 2007 updates current law to better protect intellectual property, enhance patent quality and increase public confidence in the integrity of patents. Specifically, the Act helps individuals and companies obtain money for research, commercialize inventions, expand businesses and create new jobs, added Smith. The Patent Reform Act also protects intellectual property by addressing critical weaknesses in the current law and eliminating the legal gamesmanship that rewards lawsuit abuse over creativity. Protecting the ideas and inventions of individuals and businesses expands the American economy, concluded Smith. All businesses, small and large, will benefit from this bill. I am pleased with todays vote and look forward to working with the Senate to ensure these necessary and important changes to the patent system become law. The legislation was co-sponsored by Congressmen Howard Berman (D-CA) and Lamar Smith (R-TX).
08.29.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith has announced the Hill Country Daily Bread Ministries (HCDBM) has been awarded a $189;250 grant from the Department of Education. The funds will be used for the WE CAN%21 Student Mentoring Program that provides mentors to local Boerne ISD students in elementary through high school. Local mentoring programs benefit not only the children involved but the community they live in; Smith said. I cant think of a better organization to implement a program like this. ""The chance for BISD; SAM'S Kids; UTSA and WE CAN%21 to work together has the potential to radically unite us to love these students and empower them to dream big dreams; said Dianne Benac; Program Director; WE CAN%21 Student Mentoring Program. We are gratified to hear that the work of the WE CAN%21 mentoring program can now continue and expand. The WE CAN%21 team has provided a deep level of mentoring and service that is perhaps the key difference between success and failure for needy children in our midst. I cannot conceive of a more deserving program for this grant “ and am ecstatic that these funds will help dedicated people do great things for children; said John P. Kelly; Superintendent Boerne ISD. The HCDBM was founded in 2000 and serves more than 800 households through the Family Mentoring Resource Program. They serve Bexar; Bandera; Comal; Gillespie; Kendall and Kerr counties. This federal assistance demonstrates a commitment by the federal government to provide local groups with needed funds to promote worthy programs; Smith concluded. Congressman Smith visited the HCDBM facility in April of this year to see how the organization ran and what services they offered to local residents. If you would like to contact; participate or donate to the HCDBM you can do so at https://www.hillcountrydailybread.org/.
08.16.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith has notified the Kerrville Fire Department that they have been awarded a $43;619 grant through the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The funds will be used to purchase 21 handheld portable waterproof radios and the associated communications equipment. The 54-member Kerrville Fire Department serves a 17-square-mile area and assists the volunteer fire departments in Kerr County. The fire department provides 24-hour protection and maintains about 1;000 fire hydrants inside the city. This federal grant will help the fire department acquire handheld equipment so they can do their jobs more safely; Smith said. It will enhance their ability to serve residents of Kerrville and Kerr County. Having these types of devices will enhance the safety of the firefighters and fire ground operations; said Assistant Fire Chief Mark Beavers. These firefighters are committed to protecting the lives and property of their neighbors; Smith said. This federal assistance program demonstrates a commitment by the federal government to provide them with equipment that fire departments like ours need. The Kerrville Fire Department is led by Fire Chief Raymond Halloway. If you would like to contact the Kerrville Fire Department you can do so at https://www.kerrville.org/index.asp%3fNID=107. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is administered through the Department of Homeland Security Preparedness Directorate Office of Grants and Training and the United States Fire Administration.
08.10.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement regarding the Administrations proposed reforms to address border security and immigration challenges. The Administrations announcement regarding immigration and border security reforms is a step towards enforcing our Nations laws, stated Smith. While increasing the focus on worksite enforcement and training state and local officials is essential to preventing illegal immigration, much more still needs to be done. Many of the Administrations initiatives still fall short of enforcing existing law, said Smith. In fact, real immigration reform would be simply to enforce current immigration laws. For example, Congress called for 18,000 Border Patrol agents by the end of 2008 in the ˜Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, continued Smith. Todays announcement merely implements what Congress has already enacted. While the Administration claims they have ended ˜catch and release, this policy only applies to illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico who are apprehended at the border. Smith stated. Ninety-seven percent of all illegal immigrants arrested are simply returned to their home country without prosecution, added Smith. To enforce the law, anyone crossing the border illegally must be apprehended, detained, prosecuted and ultimately, deported. While Im pleased that the Administration has said they will implement U.S.-VISIT exit procedures at air and seaports by the end of 2008, this is nothing new, Smith continued. Congress first mandated an entry-exit tracking system 11 years ago. It is time for the Administration to ensure U.S.-VISIT exit procedures are implemented at land ports of entry, as well. The problem of illegal immigration also applies to those who enter legally on a temporary visa and choose to stay, Smith said. Visitors who have overstayed their visas make up nearly 40 percent of all illegal immigrants in the U.S. Without tracking the exit of visitors, there is no way to tell whether people who entered on short-term visas ever return home.
08.06.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) has announced that San Antonio Fighting Back Inc. has been awarded a $175;000 grant through the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over DOJ. The funds will be used to decrease drug; gang and crime activity in San Antonio. These funds will allow San Antonio Fighting Back the means to decrease crime and implement their message that a community can come together to overcome the negative effects of crime; violence and substance abuse; said Ranking Member Smith. This is a way for the community to come together to address crime and this grant will provide economic development; said Linda Tippins; San Antonio Fighting Back; Inc.s Executive Vice President. Its like a shot in the arm; a vaccination if you will; that will allow additional resources to be channeled into this community. Resources that can begin to heal the disease of addiction and crime that plague this area. The grant is part of the Weed and Seed community-based strategy sponsored by DOJ that aims to prevent; control and reduce violent crime; drug abuse; and gang activity in high-crime neighborhoods across the country. There are more than 300 Weed and Seed communities ranging in size from a few blocks to several square miles. The program involves a two-pronged approach where local law enforcement agencies cooperate in weeding out violent criminals and drug abuses. Public agencies; like San Antonio Fighting Back; collaborate to seed in human services including stabilizing the neighborhood through rehabilitation and revitalization activities. San Antonio Fighting Back is the perfect organization to help implement this strategy; concluded Ranking Member Smith.
08.02.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted for the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007 (H.R. 2272). The bipartisan bill would provide students, teachers, businesses and workers the tools to compete in the 21st century economy. To compete in todays high-tech global economy we need to encourage innovation, foster creativity and promote a talented workforce, said Congressman Smith. This is a critical challenge facing our country. This bill provides $43.3 billion for research and education programs at the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and for early career awards and teacher professional development programs at the Department of Energy. Specifically, this legislation provides for $22 billion in funding for fiscal years 2008-2010 for the National Science Foundation, $95 million for fiscal year 2008 to the Math Now for Elementary School and Middle School Students Program, and $1.63 billion in fiscal year 2008 for the NIST Technology and Innovation program, among many other programs. The Senate passed H.R. 2272 on July 19, 2007. The House-Senate Conference Report was agreed to on July 31, 2007. This legislation now heads to the Senate for final approval. Should the Senate approve the bill, it will then go to the President for his approval. The legislation offers incentives for students to pursue careers in math and science and ensures American classrooms are filled with highly qualified teachers, said Smith. These measures ensure the next generations of Americans are prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.
07.27.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced the survey results of his June 2007 district wide newsletter. The survey was included in a newsletter that was sent to constituents across the 21st District. Almost 2;000 responses were received. Here are the results of the survey: 1. Tell me which issues are most important to you: (Note: respondents were able to choose more than one selection) Immigration: 76.72% Iraq: 63.11% Taxes: 48.78% Health care: 43.75% Veterans: 40.19% Environment: 26.58% 2. Do you think illegal immigrants should be legalized and allowed to stay in the United States%3f No: 82.67% Yes: 13.36% No Opinion: 2.79% 3. Do you support keeping U.S. troops in Iraq until we have won the War on Terror%3f Yes: 53.66% No: 39.38% No Opinion: 4.42% As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee and a member of the Immigration Reform Caucus; I understand why over 76% of respondents listed immigration as an issue they feel is important. Legal immigration has had a positive impact on the United States and we should continue to welcome immigrants who respect our laws. However; illegal immigration hurts American citizens and legal immigrants who end up paying taxes that go toward health care; education; welfare; and other social costs associated with illegal immigration. I recently introduced H.R. 2954; the Secure Borders FIRST Act of 2007; to overhaul our nations immigration system. This legislation ensures that we secure our borders; verifies that workers are lawfully present in this country; and encourages the assimilation of lawful immigrants into American society. I will continue to work to strengthen our border security and continue my efforts to reform our immigration policies. Progress is being made in Iraq. In October 2005; Iraqi voters approved a new permanent constitution. In December 2005; nearly 12 million Iraqis chose a permanent government in free elections under the new constitution. In March 2007; the Iraqi government approved a $41 billion budget that includes $10 billion for reconstruction and capital investment and $7.3 billion for development of Iraqi Security Forces. The men and women in our armed forces face one of the gravest threats of our time. Each day our troops confront terrorists who hate our country; our citizens; our freedoms and our way of life. We must give our brave service men and women the resources and support they deserve. I do not believe Congress should set an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal from Iraq. That second-guesses our generals and plays into the hands of the enemy. However; I also believe we cannot become a crutch for the new Iraqi government. It must stand on its own and provide for its own security as soon as possible. According to the Department of Defense; the 21st District of Texas is home to more military retirees than any other district in Texas. In fact; out of 435 congressional districts across the country; our district ranks sixth in largest number of military retirees. As a result; I have a strong record of supporting veterans and military retirees. The men and women who serve our country deserve our respect and gratitude. I have voted to improve the TRICARE program; increase funding for veterans healthcare including mental health service programs; revise the Survivor Benefit Program; provide financial assistance for homeless veterans; expand GI benefits; and increase Cost of Living Adjustments. It is very helpful to me to have the benefit of my constituents perspective on issues confronting the country and I would like to thank all those who participated in the newsletter survey. For more information on my work in Congress or to send me an electronic message; feel free to visit the 21st District's website; https://lamarsmith.house.gov.
07.26.2007	” The Committee on the Judiciary unanimously passed Ranking Member Lamar Smiths (R-TX) Stop Aids in Prison Act of 2007 by a voice vote. The bill requires the FBI to test all federal prison inmates for HIV upon entering prison and prior to release. Requiring federal inmates to be tested when they enter and leave prison is just good common sense, stated Smith. This reasonable requirement will enable prison officials to reduce the occurrence of HIV among inmates and provide much-needed counseling, prevention and health care services for inmates. There are approximately 170,000 prisoners in the federal system, continued Smith. The Justice Department estimates that approximately 1.9 percent of state prison inmates and 1.1 percent of federal inmates are known to be infected with HIV. It is important that prisoners are tested shortly before release into the community so that services can be coordinated for the prisoner and to protect the community. I believe in tough punishment for criminal offenders because the public deserves to be protected, concluded Smith. But tough punishment includes humane rehabilitation. We have a duty to treat prisoners humanely. To me, preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS among prisoners is an essential aspect of humane treatment and rehabilitation.
07.26.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that he has obtained $3 million for the Southwest Research Institute. The funds were included in the Defense Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. Funding for this project would be used to develop clothing to react to rapidly evolving situations when in military combat. Soldiers clothing would include sensors; actuators and computation abilities. These types of protective clothing could detect chemical; biological and other hazards that can potentially harm soldiers; said Smith. This funding would help develop solutions to keep our troops safe. This bill also includes more than $10.9 million for Fort Sam Houston for the Support to Global Repositioning of Forces. The funding breakdown is; $730 K for Right-size Army Community Services; $283 K for Carmy Community Services Mobilization/Deployment Support and $9.8 million for Facility Sustainment; Restoration; and Modernization. These funds will be used to fix barracks and enhance community services. This funding will strengthen San Antonios reputation as a community working to assure the most efficient and effective use of our defense resources; concluded Smith. The bill will now head to the House floor for consideration. Final funding levels will be determined near the end of the year.
07.26.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that he has obtained $4.5 million to help fund defense projects in Austin. The funds were included in the Defense Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. $1.5 million of the funds would be for a project at the University of Texas (Austin). Funding for this project would be used for building a team of researchers who will work with a large number of U.S. corporations to create next generation wireless communication and devices to be used by our military. UT Austin is positioned to lead a world-class program to develop new; innovative military-related technology; said Smith. The unique research capability within UT Austin will provide long term benefit to our nation. The other $3 million would go to Applied Physical Electronics to continue the development of systems and technology to alleviate terrorist roadside bombs. Congressman John Carter and Congressman Michael McCaul also sponsored this project. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and vehicle bombs pose threats to our troops overseas each day; said Smith. This funding would help develop solutions to keep our troops safe. ""We are extremely pleased with the funding provided in House Defense Appropriations bill for our Electro-Magnetic Flak Impulse systems and are cautiously optimistic that the money will remain in the final version of the legislation to be sent to the President later this year; said CEO of Applied Physical Electronics Jon Mayes. This will bring APELC closer to fielding our technology to defend against the Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) being used against our soldiers by terrorists abroad and to help secure our borders at home."" The bill will now head to the House floor for consideration. Final funding levels will be determined near the end of the year.
07.25.2007	House Republicans today introduced legislation to help law enforcement officials combat violent crime, prevent terrorism and protect Americas children from sexual predators. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH), Republican Whip Roy Blunt (R-MO), Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX), and other House Republicans today proposed legislation to help law enforcement officials fight crime and keep American communities safe. The comprehensive package offered today equips law enforcement with the tools and resources they need to battle violent crime, protect children from sexual exploitation and pornography, dismantle violent gangs, and eradicate methamphetamine. The package also aids the War on Terror by targeting terrorist financing schemes and attacking those who materially support or supply terrorists, said Republican Leader Boehner. I want to thank Lamar Smith, Randy Forbes, and our Members for introducing this important legislation and for highlighting some of the real problems facing many of our families and communities. Im hopeful Democrats will work with us in a bipartisan manner to address these bills on behalf of the American people. The bills will reduce violent crime, protect Americas children from sexual predators, prevent terrorism and promote national security, combat violent gangs, stop methamphetamine traffickers, guard against criminal aliens and smugglers, and preserve intellectual property rights. While Democrats waste time holding hearings on personnel matters, Republicans are working hard to make Americans safer by strengthening laws against violent crime, stated Ranking Member Smith. In the past six months, 39 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty, more than 7,500 murders were committed and 5,600 children were sexually solicited online, continued Smith. In a recent report, MySpace estimated there were nearly 30,000 sex offenders on its site. These numbers are troubling, and it is our duty to address these problems, said Smith. Its time for Democrats to stop playing partisan politics and start working to protect the American people. Republicans are committed to protecting the American people and staying tough on crime, concluded Smith. I applaud the efforts of Republicans today for their dedication to the safety and security of America. And I encourage Democrats to consider which is more important to the American people: the justified dismissal of eight U.S. Attorneys or the 750,000 violent crimes committed in neighborhoods and communities over the past six months. The American people deserve nothing less than an all out assault on violent criminals, not Administration officials. House Republicans today introduced the following bills to strengthen law enforcement and decrease crime: Fighting Violent Crime: Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA)”Violent Crime Prevention and Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3142) Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA)”Death to Cop Killers Act of 2007 (H.R. 3153) Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL)”State and Local Criminal Laboratory Enhancement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3151) Protecting Children: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)”Sex Offender Internet Prohibition Act of 2007 (H.R. 3144) Rep. Jon Porter (R-NV)”Protecting Americas Children Act of 2007 (H.R. 3149) Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (R-CO)”Child Pornography Elimination Act of 2007 (H.R. 3148) Preventing Terrorism and Promoting National Security: Rep. Geoff Davis (R-KY)”Combating Terrorism Financing Act of 2007 (H.R. 3146) Rep. Heather Wilson (R-NM)”Counter-Terrorism and National Security Act of 2007 (H.R. 3146) Addressing Gang Violence: Rep. Ric Keller (R-FL)”Anti-Gang Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3150) Rep. Charles Dent (R-PA)”Anti-Gang Task Force Act of 2007 (H.R. 3152) Stopping Meth Traffickers Rep.

Thelma Drake (R-VA)”Prohibition Against Criminal Alien Re-entry Act of 2007 (H.R. 3145) Rep. Mark Souder (R-IN)”Alien Smuggling Criminal Enterprise Deterrence Act of 2007 (H.R. 3154) Protecting Intellectual Property: Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH)”Intellectual Property Enhanced Criminal Enforcement Act of 2007 (H.R. 3155) Smith and Forbes also introduced the Violent Crime Control Act of 2007 (H.R. 3156), an omnibus crime bill that will provide tools needed to reduce violent crime, protect the country from terrorist attacks, dismantle dangerous street gangs, apprehend sex offenders who prey on our children, compensate victims of crime and shut down illegal money laundering operations. The bill includes specific proposals made by the Justice Department to reduce violent crime and terrorism, and incorporates proposals by Ranking Member Smith, Crime Subcommittee Ranking Member Forbes, former California Attorney General Dan Lungren, and Representatives Steve Chabot and Louie Gohmert.
07.23.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that he has obtained $2 million for the USDA Knipling-Bushland Livestock Insect Research Laboratory. The funds were included in the Agriculture; Rural Development; Food and Drug Administrations Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. Construction for a new lab is needed to meet growing demands; said Smith. Progression of this important research will only be realized through additional funding. The lab has operated in Kerrville since 1962 and generates information and solutions for livestock pest management problems benefiting livestock in the U.S. and worldwide. These funds would allow for economic growth for the city and the county; concluded Smith. In February 2007; Kerr County passed a resolution requesting and supporting federal funding for a new facility to house the Knipling-Bushland U.S. livestock insect research laboratory. The bill is now headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.19.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that he has obtained $400;000 to help fund projects in Austin. The funds were included in the Transportation; Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. $150;000 of the funds would be for East Austin Facade Improvements which serve a low and moderate-income neighborhood. This project will improve commercial buildings by renovating or restoring their building facades. By revitalizing these neighborhoods Austins businesses will flourish; said Smith. This funding will help the local economy and make this area an even better place to live and do business. The other $250;000 would go to Austin Intelligent Transportation Systems and will be used to put in computerized signals; cameras; traffic monitors and intersection sensors; in key growth areas of the City of Austin. Austin is growing; and our transportation system must grow with it; said Smith. This funding is an investment in Austins future. These funds will help advance our efforts to address traffic congestion and to revitalize East Austin by helping small businesses; said Austin Mayor Will Wynn. I am pleased that Rep. Smith and the entire Austin congressional delegation are committed to supporting priority projects that will improve the lives of Austins citizens. The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.19.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $1.5 million for VIA Metropolitan Transit to help modernize a 60-year-old maintenance facility, which is the key piece of infrastructure that sustains the daily operations of one of the nations largest transit systems. The funds were included in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. VIA is the largest transit organization in the U.S. to operate from only one facility, said Smith. VIAs facility is in need of repair and upgrades to keep up with growing demands.VIA had a twelve percent increase in ridership during in 2006, with more than 41,500,000 passenger trips during the year. Additionally, the senior population in the San Antonio area is expected to increase more than ten percent by year 2010, which will increase ridership. As the community shifts its dependence from the automobile to public transportation, federal funding will allow VIA to introduce technologies and properly maintain the fleet in an efficient and cost effective manner."The House's decision to fund two VIA projects is a credit to all members of the San Antonio delegation and their understanding of how this funding can make a difference in the future of our community, said VIA General Manager John Milam. "We appreciate Congressman Lamar Smith's involvement in this bipartisan effort as it demonstrates improving transit assets in San Antonio is a shared goal for all our leaders."Our public transportation must grow with San Antonios growth, said Smith. This money will be used to expand the citys transportation system. It will help San Antonio residents get around more quickly and easily. The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.18.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith has announced that San Antonio has been awarded a $6.75 million grant through the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program (UASI) at the Department of Homeland Security. The funds for the city will be used to enhance San Antonios homeland security capabilities, said Smith. We must improve our threat assessments and establish an intelligence infrastructure that attacks and exposes terrorist threats. By doing so, we can prevent another terrorist attack and save thousands of lives. The UASI funds address the unique planning, equipment, training, and exercise needs of high threat, high density urban areas, and assist them in building an enhanced and sustainable capacity to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism. This is a $2 million increase over 2006 funding, said Smith. It is not enough to check for threats once theyve reached American soil. We must prevent them from ever reaching our major cities.
07.18.2007	The Committee on the Judiciary today passed Ranking Member Lamar Smiths (R-TX) Patent Reform Act of 2007 (H.R. 1908) by a voice vote. The bill represents the most significant update to patent law since the 1952 Act was written. Few issues are as important to the economic strength of the United States as our ability to create and protect intellectual property, stated Ranking Member Smith. The Patent Reform Act of 2007 updates current law to better protect intellectual property, enhance patent quality and increase public confidence in the integrity of patents. The Act implements a first-to-file standard consistent with international practice, creates a post-grant opposition system to weed out bad patents, clarifies how damages are determined in valid disputes and reduces the number of frivolous lawsuits. All businesses, small and large, will benefit from this bill, Smith continued. The Act helps individuals and companies obtain money for research, commercialize inventions, expand businesses and create new jobs, added Smith. American IP industries account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of the countrys economic growth and employ 18 million Americans. A recent study valued U.S. intellectual property at $5 trillion dollars “ or about half of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. IP industries not only drive a significant part of the American economy, but also provide millions of Americans with well-paying jobs, said Smith. The Patent Reform Act protects intellectual property by addressing critical weaknesses in the current law and eliminating the legal gamesmanship that rewards lawsuit abuses over creativity. Protecting the ideas and inventions of individuals and businesses expands the American economy, Smith concluded. I am pleased with todays decision and look forward to the Acts approval on the House floor in the coming weeks.
07.17.2007	Today several Austin area Congressmen announced that the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been awarded more than $6 million in grants from the Department of Transportation. The funds will be used to purchase buses for expanded service and to construct the South Central Transit Center. We are grateful to our Congressional delegation for their hard work on our behalf and their continued support of transportation initiatives for Central Texas, said Capital Metro President/CEO Fred Gilliam. The Texas Representatives made the following statements: Congressman Lamar Smith: Austin is growing, and our public transportation systems must grow with it. This money will be used to expand the citys bus system to surrounding communities. It will help Austin residents get around more quickly and easily. Congressman Michael McCaul: "This grant will help take cars off of Austin area roads and highways and in turn reduce emissions," stated Congressman Michael McCaul (R-Austin). He went on to say, "It is my hope that Capital Metro and local officials will build upon this federal money and continue to increase the capabilities and capacity of public transit in Austin in an efficient and effective manner." Congressman John Carter: Central Texas is growing at record rates and thankfully, due to these funds, Capital Metro will be able to expand to accommodate the population increases. These grants will allow residents in and outside the city of Austin to travel at a quicker pace and ease congestion on Austins major roads.
07.12.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $150,000 to help fund the City of Austin Police Department. The funds were included in the Commerce, Justice and Science Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. The funds for this project would be used to purchase a driving simulator, said Smith. This simulator will keep officers safe and in a controlled environment where they can learn."Officers spend much of their time in their patrol cars responding to critical calls for police service. With the driving simulator, our officers will receive a real time driving experience without the danger of injury. Not only is the driving simulator a cost effective method to protect the city's investment in a patrol vehicle, but more importantly, by honing their driving skills, our officers will have the training they need to make our streets safer and save lives," said Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo.The new simulator would be able to detect the manner in which the officer is driving and make changes to the scenarios environment thus allowing the officers to train and learn in otherwise dangerous situations. Police officers put their lives on the line to keep our neighborhoods and community safe, said Smith. The residents of Austin along with the police department would benefit from these funds.The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.12.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $375,000 to help fund the City of Kerrville Police Department. The funds were included in the Commerce, Justice and Science Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. The funds for this project would be used to purchase new technology and equipment to assist police officers in the city, said Smith. The City of Kerrville is fortunate to have an advocate with the leadership abilities of Congressman Smith and we sincerely appreciate his efforts, said Kerrville City Manager Paul A. Hofmann.Police officers put their lives on the line to keep our neighborhoods and community safe, said Smith. The residents of Kerrville along with the police department would benefit from these funds.The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.12.2007	Today several San Antonio Congressmen announced that they have secured more than $3 million for San Antonio projects. These projects include: $2 million for the San Antonio Channel Improvement Project, $1.35 million for the Guadalupe and San Antonio River Basins Project and $500 K for Nueces River and Tributaries Project. Representatives Ciro Rodriguez (TX-23), Lamar Smith (TX-21) and Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20) worked to have the funds included in the FY 2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. The San Antonio Channel Improvement Project will restore natural riverbank to the southern San Antonio channel. It is administered by the San Antonio River Authority (SARA) championed by San Antonio government and business community. The San Antonio Channel Improvement Project emphasizes the maintenance of current flood control protection, the improvement of recreational and cultural opportunities, and the restoration of a natural and sustainable ecosystem along the riverbank. Tom Weaver, Director, San Antonio River Authority, District 4: Thanks to the hard work of Congressmen Rodriguez, Smith and Gonzalez during this appropriations cycle the Corps of Engineers will have funding to begin construction on the Mission Reach portion of the San Antonio River Improvements Project. Because our delegation made this project a top priority, a significant milestone for our community will be realized. Weaver added, "We will continue to support their efforts to secure the funding for this important project as the process moves through the conference committee this summer. The Guadalupe and San Antonio River Basins Project will allow for studies to be preformed that will address flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration, water supply and water quality. The studies will help identify alternatives to reduce the threat of flooding to property by identifying flood risk factors and recognizing projects to lessen the loss of life and property. The Nueces River and Tributaries Project will restore ecosystems of the Nueces River Delta. The funds will also reduce the damages associated with flooding events in the basin and increase the volume of stream flows for the benefit of endangered species in the area. David E. Chardavoyne, SAWS President and CEO: "I thank Congressmen Ciro Rodriguez, Lamar Smith, and Charlie Gonzalez for their work to help provide the best science and methods for a long-term solution for the sustainability of the Nueces River Basin. This study will pave the way for new recharge structures over the Edwards Aquifer for additional water capacity and to protect flows at Comal and San Marcos Springs." The Texas Representatives made the following statements after passage of the bill from the Committee on Appropriations: Congressman Ciro Rodriguez: As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to work with my fellow San Antonians to support these San Antonio River projects and the economic development that will result for the Alamo City. By working together and with our local leaders, we are paving the way for this river restoration and revitalization project. Congressman Lamar Smith: The valuable water projects will provide a tremendous investment to San Antonio by improving environmental and public safety. This is a good example of a bipartisan delegation working together to help our city. Congressman Charlie Gonzalez: These programs hold great economic and environmental significance in San Antonio and Im proud that together, the San Antonio delegation was successful in their fight to include these funds in the Committees appropriation bill. I applaud the efforts of my colleagues who have yet again displayed a strong commitment to these vital projects for the San Antonio community. The FY 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill now moves to the full U.S. House of Representatives for consideration next week.
07.11.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $100,000 to help fund the Rainbow Senior Center in Boerne. The funds were included in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. These funds will be used to furnish and equip a new state of the art facility, said Smith. The Rainbow Senior Center keeps seniors active, independent and involved in the community. The members, staff and Board of Directors of the Rainbow Senior Center are very excited about the $100,000 contribution provided by Congressman Lamar Smith. We are deeply grateful that he had the confidence in our mission and programs to work on our behalf. We are very fortunate to have a Congressman like Mr. Smith representing our district, said Rainbow Senior Center Executive Director Carolyn Stauss.The Rainbow Senior Center was founded in 1983 and more than 100 senior adults participate in the programs and activities each day. I have visited the senior center and know that these funds will be put to great use for the seniors in the community, added Smith.The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.11.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $150,000 to help fund a teaching laboratory at Trinity University. The funds were included in the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. These funds will be used to prepare teachers to work with technology in the classroom, said Smith. Trinity University is a leader in teacher preparation and I can think of no better place for this lab. "Trinity University applauds Congressman Smith's efforts to secure funding for the Educators' Technology Teaching Laboratory that will benefit public school teachers and students. These educators and students are well served by Trinity's nationally-recognized teacher preparation programs that lead to a masters' degree in teaching, school administration, and school counseling," said Trinity University President John R. Brazil. The funds would be used to create an Educators Technology Teaching Laboratory. It would train teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade public schools in the South Texas Region as well as students preparing to become teachers. Teaching is one of the most honorable professions in America. Teachers have one of the greatest responsibilities--that of educating our children, added Smith. The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.11.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $200,000 to help fund three, community libraries in Bandera County. The funds were included in the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. These funds will be used to enhance the collections at each library and extend operating hours, said Smith. There is absolutely nothing more valuable to an individual than a good education, and there is nothing more valuable to a community than an educated populace and libraries play a fundamental role in that process.On behalf of the citizens of Bandera County, I would like to personally thank Congressman Smith and his staff for securing funding for our county federated library system. This grant will benefit all our citizens--young and old, rural and urban--and will enable the libraries to expand services to the public. Again, thank you for leadership and commitment to the people you serve, said Bandera County Judge Richard Evans.The funds would go to Bandera Kronkosky Library, Medina Community Library and Lakehills Library Association. These libraries rely on donations, grants and funding from the Bandera County Commissioners Court to operate their facilities and provide library services to the residents of Bandera County.It is vital that all children have access to books since reading plays an instrumental role in education and these funds will increase that access, added Smith.The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
07.10.2007	The House of Representatives today approved the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, (H.R. 660) co-sponsored by Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX). In recent years we have seen an increase in violence and threats against Judges, witnesses, courthouse personnel and law enforcement officials, Smith explained. Seven hundred threats against federal judges are made each year. The problem of witness intimidation continues to grow, particularly at the state and local level, where few resources are available to protect witnesses, victims and their families, stated Smith. This problem threatens the very integrity of our judicial system. The bipartisan bill provides grants to state and local courts to improve security services, prohibits public disclosure of the personal information of courthouse personnel, improves security measures for federal prosecutors and increases criminal penalties for assault against federal law enforcement officers. This legislation is a bipartisan effort to improve the security of those who administer our justice system, concluded Smith. This bill represents a significant step in protecting court personnel.
07.05.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) this week conducted three interviews to kick off his participation in the Veterans History Project (VHP). The VHP honors veterans and civilian workers by collecting stories of their service. The VHP, created by Congress in 2000, relies on volunteer efforts to document stories of Americas veterans. By taking part in this project, veterans are contributing to the permanent Veterans History Project collections at the Library of Congress, one of the worlds most respected research and cultural institutions. The collections are then archived and made available to researchers and the general public. This project will preserve past memories so that future generations understand what protecting freedom means to these veterans, said Congressman Smith. I am glad to participate in this memorial collection that shows the sacrifices made by all veterans. Congressman Smith conducted his three interviews in Kerrville, San Antonio and Austin. Participating in those interviews was: Veteran Robert Weinberg, Marine Lance Cpl. Eric Morante and Staff Sgt. Guadalupe Recio. They interviewees talked with the Congressman for thirty minutes about their time in the service, experiences they had and life after the military. There are more than 1.6 million veterans who live in Texas and more than 75,800 of those live in the 21st District. To participate in the VHP please contact the Washington, D.C. Congressional office at (202) 225-4236 or visit the VHP Website at: https://www.loc.gov/vets/. Texas veterans and volunteers have a wonderful opportunity to record the past and preserve it for future," concluded Smith.
07.03.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith has announced that the University of Texas (Austin) has been awarded a $280,844 grant through the Department of Education. The funds will be used for Proyecto Maestria a masters program that will allow Austin area teachers to come to UT to better prepare to serve children in their classrooms with limited English language skills. These funds will better enhance teachers so they have the tools to teach children learning English, said Congressman Smith. This is an area of need and I can think of no better place than UT Austin for this program. The grant will provide scholarships to a cohort of certified and experienced bilingual teachers so that they can return to school for their masters degrees in a specially designed program, said Deborah Palmer, Assistant Professor of Bilingual/Bicultural Education at UT Austin. They will learn not only to do an even better job for the students in their own classrooms, but also to assist in the preparation and mentoring of fellow teachers. Graduates of the masters program, called "Proyecto Maestria," will use their skills to mentor colleagues in ESL (English as a Second Language) and bilingual teaching. The grant will also fund a special summer institute to provide training to in-service teachers interested in moving into ESL and bilingual settings.
06.28.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today issued the following statement on the defeat on the Senate amnesty bill: This is a huge victory for the American people. They have spoken and their representatives have heard them. We still need to address the problem of illegal immigration in America. The best way to do that is to enforce current laws and to better secure the border.
06.27.2007	The House Science and Technology Committee today approved major solar energy legislation introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith. The Science and Technology Committee passed Congressman Lamar Smiths SUN Act of 2007, which he inserted as an amendment to the Solar Energy Research and Advancement Act of 2007 (H.R. 2774). Smiths SUN Act establishes a competitive grant program to encourage state governments and private industry to team up to demonstrate solar technology. The answer to much of Americas energy needs rises in the east every morning, said Congressman Smith. Solar power is clean, plentiful, has zero emissions, zero waste and unlike other forms of energy that America must import, solar energy is homegrown. The SUN Act encourages state government and private industry to team up to apply for federal grants. This will enable them to buy solar energy panels at nearly half the cost. Under Smiths legislation, states are required to contribute at least 10 percent of the funding. The federal government matches the grant at a maximum of 40 percent. The rest would come from utilities or private industry. Since the grants are competitive, there is an incentive for states and utilities to pledge more than the minimum amounts. Every state would be eligible to participate in the program. The program would be authorized at $15 million the first year and rise to $70 million in fiscal year 2012. Texas ranks first in the nation in solar resource potential and by 2015, Texas will produce 5,880 megawatts of energy from renewable sources like solar power. By encouraging communities to embrace solar energy we can increase demand for solar power, broaden our knowledge of the technology and eventually lower its costs, concluded Smith. H.R. 2774 was reported out of the Science and Technology Committee and is now scheduled for House floor consideration.
06.21.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (Rˆ’TX) today announced that he has obtained $300,000 to help expand the boundaries of the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. The funds were included in the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill that passed the Committee on Appropriations. Said Smith, These funds will be used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for land acquisition to help complete the boundaries of the refuge and protect endangered species. We are elated Congressman Smith has succeeded in obtaining funds for land acquisition at Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge in this very tight budget year, said James E. Gilchrist, Friends of Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. This money will be used to conserve habitat for the Golden-cheeked Warbler and Black-capped Vireo, two endangered songbirds. Additionally, these funds will help preserve a piece of the Texas Hill Country for future generations. It is important to protect Americas endangered species and the Balcones Canyonlands wildlife refuge offers our region a variety of opportunities to experience the wonders and beauty of endangered wildlife in their habitat, added Smith. Balcones Canyonlands Refuge is located in West Travis County.
06.21.2007	Today several San Antonio Congressmen announced that they have obtained $500,000 for the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) to replace and expand the water and wastewater infrastructure. San Antonio has more than 9,000 miles of water and sewer mains buried below the 560 square miles that the SAWS serves. Representatives Ciro Rodriguez (TX-23), Lamar Smith (TX-21) and Charlie Gonzalez (TX-20) worked to have the funds included in the FY 2008 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. "We are grateful to Congressman Rodriguez, Congressman Smith, and Congressman Gonzalez for their support of this project. We especially thank Congressman Rodriguez who, as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, marshaled this funding through the legislative process. Their bipartisan effort on behalf of San Antonio residents is commendable, and we will benefit from their diligence in helping SAWS ensure the safety and environmental integrity of our wastewater system. We will continue working with our Congressional delegation to ensure that San Antonio enjoys the highest quality water and wastewater services in the nation," David E. Chardavoyne, SAWS President and CEO The Texas Representatives made the following statements after passage of the bill from the Committee on Appropriations: Congressman Ciro Rodriguez: As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to work with my fellow San Antonians to support SAWS and the expansion of high quality water resources in the Alamo City. By working together, our San Antonio Representatives have paved the way for a cleaner environment and water for San Antonio. Congressman Lamar Smith: We are happy to have this funding for essential wastewater improvements. These funds will benefit San Antonio and its citizens by improving the efficiency of our citys wastewater infrastructure. This is a good example of a bipartisan delegation working together to help our city. Congressman Charlie Gonzalez: Im grateful that the committee has included vital funding in this years appropriations bill for a program of such great importance to the San Antonio community. I look forward to continuing to work with the rest of the San Antonio delegation to ensure that SAWS receives the proper resources it needs through out the course of this project. The bill will now be headed to the House floor for consideration.
06.20.2007	The House of Representatives today approved a civil rights bill cosponsored by Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) known as the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007, (H.R. 923). Today, Members of Congress from all backgrounds and experiences joined together to ensure the swift prosecution of civil rights-era crimes, which were sometimes ignored, stated Smith. Congressman Smith addressed the Congress today and urged his colleagues to support the bill. During his speech Smith noted that last week, marked the 44th anniversary of the murder of civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Before his death, Medgar Evers was a primary, although unofficial, investigator of the Emmett Till murder. Last week, the Committee which Smith helps lead was privileged to hear from his widow, Ms. Myrlie Evers Williams, who testified that the conviction of Medgars killer in 1994 “ 31 years after his murder “ gave a sense of hope to those who experienced this bleak time in our nations history. The bill provides much-needed resources and federal funding to help the Justice Department and the FBI to prosecute unsolved civil rights-era homicides. It also designates new high-level positions with the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division to investigate and prosecute unsolved civil rights-era murders. Time is running out for other unsolved civil rights-era murders, Smith asserted. We must act swiftly to help bring long overdue justice to the victims, their families, and the communities that these brutal murders so deeply affected. Smith noted that to date, the FBI has identified nearly 100 outstanding cases that still need to be assessed, many of which are forty years old. The Federal Bureau of Investigations has now joined with the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Urban League to uncover other cases, identify witnesses and gather evidence. This bill reaffirms the obligation we have to victims of past crimes, concluded Smith.
06.19.2007	Judiciary Ranking Member Lamar Smith (TX-21) today introduced a resolution calling for full enforcement of all current immigration laws. Smiths resolution outlines 12 ways in which a lack of enforcement has led to increased illegal immigration. Immigration enforcement has failed primarily because Administrations for 20 years have not enforced sanctions on employers who hire illegal immigrants, explained Ranking Member Smith. Illegal immigration will never be brought under control as long as the easy availability of jobs remains such a strong magnet. My resolution calls on the Administration to enforce employer sanctions systematically, not just sporadically, Smith said. During the press conference on his resolution, Smith explained that a lack of adequate resources has been another problem. The Administration has not requested the number of detention beds and immigration investigators and Border Patrol agents that Congress called for in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. And, it has constructed only a few of the miles of fencing called for in the Secure Fence Act. Smiths resolution calls on the Administration to seek the full complement of immigration enforcement resources called for in the Intelligence Reform Act and to fulfill the fence requirements made in the Secure Fence Act. Smith also noted that that Administrations have stood by while states and localities have violated federal law by granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants; they have allowed banks to intentionally grant illegal immigrants bank accounts, which legitimizes their presence; and they have Smith also noted that Administrations have failed to prosecute 98% of the illegal immigrants stopped at the border. Said Smith, My resolution calls on the Administration to rewrite its regulations so as not to facilitate illegal immigration and calls on them to engage in more prosecutions to create a credible deterrent to illegal entry. Administrations have also failed to implement a mandated exit control system to keep track of visa overstayers and have failed to fully make use of tools that Congress has granted to combat illegal immigration, such as expedited removal for illegal entrants. The resolution calls on the Administration to do so. The Administration claims we have a de facto amnesty now, Smith concluded. Thats true and its the result of the Administrations own lack of determination to enforce the law. We dont need amnesty to enforce current law, we need to enforce the law to eliminate the need for amnesty.
06.15.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−San Antonio) issued the following statement regarding the San Antonio Spurs fourth NBA Championship: The San Antonio Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers to win their third NBA championship in five years. Tim Duncans defense and Tony Parkers unbelievable shooting from long distance and in the paint were simply too much for the Cavs. I congratulate the Spurs on their title. However, what Im most proud of is the way in which the Spurs have won these titles. They are neither glitzy nor cocky on the court. They simply play hard and win. To me, thats the mark of a true champion. Coach Gregg Popovich ranks fifth in playoff wins and second in winning percentage and truly is one of the all-time great coaches.
06.15.2007	The House of Representatives today passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill, (H.R. 2642), which was supported by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). This bill contains the largest increase in veterans funding in the 77-year history of Veterans Affairs, stated Congressman Smith. But the money wont matter unless we can get the resources to the veterans who need it, Smith explained. Thats why this bill also provides for 1,000 new claims processors to reduce the backlog in benefits applications. The bill contains $44.6 billion for the Veterans Benefits Administration, a nearly 8 percent increase over last year; $37 billion for Veterans Health Administration, a nearly 14 percent increase over last year; and $5.9 billion for Veterans Affairs, Departmental Administration, a 63 percent increase over last year. The bill also provides $9.7 billion for military construction, a 61 percent increase over last year, and $8.4 billion for Base Realignment, a 208 percent increase over last year. Texas is undergoing major realignment of military personnel, Smith stated. This bill is essential to making sure our communities are able to absorb and accommodate the thousands of new soldiers and their families. Our military personnel, retired military personnel and their families have made difficult sacrifices for their country, Smith concluded. Today we passed a bill that appropriately honors those sacrifices.
06.14.2007	The House Judiciary Committee today approved the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, (H.R. 660) co-sponsored by Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX). Seven hundred threats against federal judges are made each year, Smith explained. In many cases, federal judges and other court house personnel have been forced to live in fear of retribution by terrorists, gangs and disgruntled litigants they helped bring to justice. The problem of witness intimidation continues to grow, particularly at the state and local level, where few resources are available to protect witnesses, victims and their families, stated Smith. This problem threatens the very integrity of our judicial system. During debate on the bill, Smith noted the killing of family members of United States District Judge Joan Lefkow and the brutal slayings of Judge Rowland Barton, his court reporter, his deputy sheriff, and a federal officer in Atlanta. The bipartisan bill provides grants to state and local courts to improve security services; prohibits public disclosure of the personal information of courthouse personnel; improves security measures for federal prosecutors; and increases criminal penalties for assault against federal law enforcement officers. Judges, witnesses, courthouse personnel and law enforcement officers should not have to face threats and violence when carrying out their duties, concluded Smith. This bill represents a significant step in protecting court personnel.
06.13.2007	The House Judiciary Committee today approved the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007, (H.R. 923) co-sponsored by Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX). This bill provides much-needed resources to the Justice Department and the FBI to prosecute unsolved civil rights-era homicides, said Congressman Smith. In addition to new federal funding, H.R. 923 also designates new high-level positions with the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division to investigate and prosecute unsolved civil rights-era murders. The Federal Bureau of Investigations has identified roughly 100 such cases and has now joined with the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Urban League to uncover other cases, identify witnesses and gather evidence. This bill reaffirms the obligation we have to victims of past crimes, concluded Smith.
06.12.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) asserted the Administrations failure to enforce current immigration laws has contributed to Americas illegal immigration problem. There is a huge gap between the Administrations words and its actions when it comes to reducing illegal immigration, Smith stated. The Administration mostly ignores worksite enforcement laws, has failed to fully implement the U.S.-Visit system, and releases most illegal immigrants on the border without prosecution. Enforcing current laws would go a long way toward reducing illegal immigration, Smith commented. Smith noted that the Administration has largely ignored laws enacted in 1986 that impose fines on businesses who employ illegal workers. In 2004, the Administration issued no violations to employers for hiring illegal immigrants. In 2005, they issued only 10. When employers know they wont be punished for hiring illegal workers, they have no incentive to stop employing illegal immigrants, Smith explained. As long as people can easily find jobs, they will continue to come to the U.S. illegally. This is a huge magnet. The Administration has also failed to implement the ˜exit portion of the U.S.-VISIT entry-exit system, continued Smith. This means there is no way to tell whether people who entered on short-term visas returned home. These people account for nearly 40 percent of all illegal immigrants and we dont know who or where they are. Smith also noted that the Administration continues to release illegal immigrants at the border, returning them without prosecution. Ninety-eight percent of illegal immigrants arrested along the U.S.-Mexico border between 2000 and 2005 were simply released across the border without prosecution. This encourages illegal immigrants to keep trying to enter illegally, and creates a revolving door of illegal immigration, stated Smith. Smith concluded, If the system is ˜broken, the Administration should fix it by enforcing current laws, not promoting an amnesty program that will only make the problem worse.
06.08.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today issued the following statement on the defeat on the Senate amnesty bill: The amnesty bills defeat is a victory for American workers, legal immigrants and the rule of law, said Ranking Member Smith. The American people want secure borders - not amnesty, Smith concluded. Its time for the House and Senate to work together to give the American people what they want.
05.31.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today advised Texans in the 21st Congressional District with plans to travel outside the country in the coming months to apply for passports at least three months in advance. Many Americans have been experiencing delays with the processing of their U.S. passport applications. I urge anyone needing a passport to fill out the application and submit it as soon as possible, said Congressman Smith. My staff has been working hard for the past several weeks assisting constituents with their passport issues, said Smith. Through working with the Passport Service we have assisted more than 350 constituents. New regulations by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that went into effect earlier this year require all U.S. citizens to present a valid U.S. passport in order to travel by air to any part of the Western Hemisphere. Though passports were not required in the past, Americans flying to Canada, Mexico or anywhere in the Caribbean now need a valid U.S. passport to re-enter the United States. Because of the new regulations, there is a backlog for processing passport applications. People who have submitted their passport application and need assistance for immediate upcoming travel should call their Congressmans office and provide their full name, date of birth, Social Security number, Locator number (that is available on the State Department Web), home address and phone number. This information is required for each person needing passport assistance. Each applicant should contact their Congressman no earlier than 10 days from their departure date. Congressman Smith along with other Representatives recently sent a letter to the Secretary of State requesting a quick resolution to the current backlog of passport requests. For more information about U.S. passports and how to apply for a passport, visit the State Department's Web site at: https://travel.state.gov/ or call the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 (TDD/TTY: 1-888-874-7793). To obtain the status of a passport application, visit https://passportstatus.state.gov/opss/OPSS_Status_i.asp.
05.31.2007	Speaking at a Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia yesterday, President Bush said the following: Those determined to find fault with this bill will always be able to look at a narrow slice of it and find something they don't like. If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it.Members of the Immigration Reform Caucus issued the following statements today following the President calling the amnesty for 12-20 million illegal immigrants just a narrow slice:Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith (R-TX): It doesn't matter how you slice it, the Senate amnesty bill is a raw deal for American workers and the rule of law. The bill treats illegal immigrants better than those who play by the rules, wait their turn and come in the right way. Either according to a law dictionary or common sense, the Senate bill is amnesty. Chairman of the IRC Brian Bilbray (R-CA): Amnesty for 12-20 million illegal immigrants isnt a narrow slice Mr. President, its the whole darn pie. What part of illegal does the President not understand? The American people want us to secure the border and crackdown on the number one incentive for illegal immigration which is illegal employment “ they dont want another amnesty. Congressman Phil Gingrey (R-GA): Sadly, the President has it backwards. There are narrow slices of this bill many of us could support, like putting border security first and ending chain migration. It is the bill as a whole thats cause for heartburn. If we pass this legislation, 12 million illegal immigrants will be on a path to citizenship without any concern for its dire impact on programs like Medicare and the education system. First and foremost, our immigration laws must support America's security, economy and society. The Senate bill fails on all three accounts. Congressman Bill Sali (R-ID): In the last week, I have conducted a tele-townhall meeting with more than 800 Idahoans, was the guest on two radio talk shows and held a number of community meetings. I can safely say the number one issue with my constituents is immigration. Not the war. Not gas prices. It's immigration. Idahoans are deeply concerned about this issue and the President's bill. This is no little thing, no small slice of pie. It's a very big deal for Idaho and America.Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD): Amnesty is not a 'narrow slice' or 'one little aspect' of the Senate immigration bill as the President argued. Awarding amnesty to 12-20 million illegal aliens is the one sure thing this bill would do. It will promote more illegal immigration by almost guaranteeing that if you can cross the border, you will be able to become a permanent U.S. resident with no obligation to become an American citizen.
05.30.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today sent a letter to OMB Director Rob Portman about a published report that a U.S. government contractor hired illegal immigrants. Incidents like this should persuade the Administration to rethink the ill-advised immigration bill now before the Senate, said Ranking Member Smith. How can we expect the federal government to enforce a massive new guest worker program when it does not abide by current laws? Smiths letter cited published reports that the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently arrested 14 illegal immigrants employed by Cutting Edge Forestry, Inc. of Oregon to conduct work on behalf of the U.S. Forestry Service. What is so troubling, writes Smith is that the illegal immigrants were doing work under Cutting Edges contract with the U.S. Forest Service. Smith applauded ICE for this all too rare interior enforcement action, but pointed out that even the federal governments contractors are not doing an adequate job of employee verification. Fortunately, however, the Basic Pilot Program already exists to address this problem, explained Smith. Smith asked Portman to do all he can to see that federal government agencies and their contractors are required to join the Basic Pilot Program to prevent these kinds of incidents. American citizens and legal immigrants deserve these jobs “ not those who have broken our laws, Smith concluded.
05.25.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today asked Mothers Against Drunk Drivers President Glynn Birch to insist that the Senate add a requirement to its immigration bill that would make drunk driving a deportable offense. MADD speaks with great moral authority, Smith wrote in his letter. I ask you to use that authority to support the Cornyn amendment. The Senates amnesty bill, as introduced, does not change current law to make drunk driving a deportable offense. However, an amendment by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) that would address this issue is expected to come up for a vote when the Senate resumes debate June 4. Smith asked MADD to support the amendment. Smith pointed to the recent case of Alfredo Ramos to illustrate the need for the provision. According to news reports, Mr. Ramos, an illegal immigrant, killed two teenage girls in Virginia Beach, Virginia when he caused an automobile accident while driving under the influence of alcohol, Smith explained. He had previous convictions for similar offenses, but he was not deported. If he had been, these girls would be alive today, concluded Smith. While his case occurred a few weeks ago, it is only one of many in which illegal immigrants with DUI convictions have not been deported.
05.25.2007	The House of Representatives this week passed measures offered by Judiciary Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) that would strengthen disclosure of political campaign contributions and lobbying activities. The public wants and deserves open and honest government, asserted Ranking Member Smith. Smiths measure, which was added to the House lobbying reform legislation approved on Thursday, would close a loophole that exempts political action committees from disclosing bundled contributions to candidates. Bundled contributions are campaign donations from several groups or individuals that are given as a single contribution and credited to the lobbyist who solicited them. Smiths proposal would require each lobbyist who gets that credit to be identified. Later in the day, the House passed an additional measure, which Smith helped author that would close a loophole allowing state and local government entities to give gifts and travel to Members and staff that other entities cant give. This measure also contained a reverse revolving door provision that would prohibit lobbyists who become congressional employees from receiving any official communication with their former private employer for a period of one year. I am pleased that Congress acted in a bipartisan way to improve disclosure, concluded Smith. This bill will make for more open and more responsive government.
05.24.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted for the U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act (H.R. 2206). This bill provides the necessary funding for troops to succeed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The funding in this bill is the least we can do to demonstrate our gratitude to our men and women in uniform, said Congressman Smith. This bill allows the President and military to make decisions during war time. This bill also provides $3.1 billion for the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Account, to fulfill the Administrations fiscal year 2007 request. Ive fought hard to ensure that BRAC is fully funded and today they will get the funds they deserve, said Smith. Fort Sam Houston, which I represent, and other San Antonio bases will benefit greatly from this funding bill.
05.24.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted for legislation that improves outreach and assistance to veterans and that provides chiropractic care for veterans. There is no greater service to our country than that performed by our military men and women, said Congressman Smith. Their sacrifices ensure that our country remains free. America's veterans deserve improved access to benefits such as health care. One of the bills, H.R. 2239, would allow severely injured service members to receive vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits prior to their discharge from active duty. Another bill, H.R. 2199, would create a comprehensive program of long-term care for traumatic brain injuries rehabilitation that includes residential, community, and home-based treatment. The following bills passed the House today with the support of Congressman Smith: H.R. 67 “ Veterans Outreach Improvement Act of 2007 H.R. 612 “ Returning Servicemember VA Healthcare Insurance Act of 2007 H.R. 1470 “ Chiropractic Available to All Veterans Act H.R. 2199 “ Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long-Term Support Act of 2007 H.R. 2239 “ Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits Act Be assured that I will continue to work on to ensure that those who served our nation receive the benefits they deserve, concluded Smith.
05.24.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today asked union leaders to join him in speaking out against the Senate bill because of its temporary worker program. Low-skilled foreign workers lower wages and take jobs away from American workers, asserted Ranking Member Smith. The proof is found in the actions of employers themselves. In his letter to three major union organizations, Smith explains that when the federal government targets companies hiring illegal workers and removes their illegal workforce, the companies consistently are able to attract legal workers. Smiths letter describes last years enforcement actions by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) involving Georgias Crider Inc., which resulted in the loss of over 600 illegal workers. The company increased wages a dollar an hour and filled those positions with legal workers. Explained Smith, The companies were forced to recruit local workers, many of whom had previously had a difficult time finding jobs. The letter was sent to John Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, James Hoffa, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Andy Stern, President of the Service Employees International Union. To protect the American workers we all represent, we must prevent this bill from becoming law, Smith wrote. Whatever our differences on the other aspects of the immigration issue, we must unite to defeat a bad deal for the American worker. Some say there are jobs Americans wont do, concluded Smith. But that demeans Americans who do work hard in every occupation.
05.24.2007	The House of Representatives today passed a lobbying reform bill that is almost identical to legislation Republicans passed on the House floor last year. The public wants and deserves open and honest government, asserted Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX). If the bill seems familiar, it is, Smith stated. It is largely the same as the lobby disclosure provisions reported out of the Republican-led Judiciary Committee last Congress. Smith quoted Mark Twain saying, Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So Republicans should feel complimented. Nearly all of the provisions in todays bill were in the Republican bill passed by the House last Congress, including disclosure of Members private-sector employment negotiations, the creation of a public lobbying database with increased frequency of lobbying disclosure, and increased penalties for lobbyist disclosure violations. Last years Republican bill went further by including a moratorium on privately funded travel. It also required lobbyists to report their expenses more precisely. The House today also approved Republican provisions aimed at strengthening the bill. The Republican-led measure would close loopholes that allow state and local government entities to give gifts and travel to Members and staff that other entities cant give. Republicans today also offered and passed a reverse revolving door provision that would prohibit lobbyists who become Congressional employees from having any official communication or appearance before their former private employer for a period of one year. I am pleased Democrats chose to support many of our original recommendations, Smith asserted. This bill will make for more open and more responsive government.
05.23.2007	Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) welcomed local San Antonio community leader Willie Mitchell to share his expertise during a Judiciary Committee hearing on the Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2007. It is a pleasure to have a local San Antonio leader share insight on this valuable bill, said Ranking Member Smith. Protecting inmates from AIDS starts them on the way to becoming productive citizens. About 170,000 people are in federal prisons. When they leave, they often return to society without knowing whether they are infected with AIDS. That poses a risk to them and the public. Upon entry into the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) system for any duration of time, all inmates receive a medical and mental health examination; however it does not currently include testing for the HIV/AIDS virus, said Mr. Mitchell. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reported that the rate of confirmed AIDS cases in prisons is three times higher than that of the general U.S. population. Two percent of state inmates and one percent of federal prison inmates were known to be living with HIV/AIDS in 2003. However, we do not know the true rate of HIV/AIDS infection because prison officials do not regularly test prisoners. As Chairman of San Antonio Fighting Back, Mr. Mitchell participates in programs like the Young Offenders/Ex-Offenders Re-Entry Coalition. This Faith-based Coalition works to keep young offenders ages 17-29 from re-offending by assisting them with job training, family counseling, community service, housing and job placement. This bipartisan bill, which Congressman Smith cosponsored, requires the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to test all prisoners for HIV/AIDS when they enter prison and when they leave. BOP will have six months to offer HIV/AIDS testing for existing inmates. This bill will slow the spread of AIDS, protect the public, and help inmates, concluded Smith.
05.18.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today urged U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency to support and expedite the request made by the San Antonio International Airport (SAIA) to be assigned permanent status as a Designated Airport. Any further delay of this request will have a significant negative economic impact on the city of San Antonio, said Congressman Smith. This designation will enhance business and trade relationships throughout Mexico. Permanent designated status would allow private aircraft arriving in the United States from foreign countries to fly directly into SAIA and clear customs. Without permanent status, private aircraft must fly into another designated airport before arriving at SAIA. The request for permanent port of entry status was made by SAIA on December 12, 2006. In the letter, Congressman Smith requests that U.S. Customs and Border Protection speed up SAIAs request for permanent designation status. Millions of tourists and business travelers visit San Antonio every year traveling through SAIA in private aircrafts, said Smith. Without this airport designation status, the city is losing out on increased tourism and economic development. That is bad for local business and bad for San Antonio, concluded Smith.
05.17.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) voted against legislation today that includes the second largest tax increase in American history. This fiscal year 2008 budget bill would raise taxes at least $217 billion by 2012. Balancing the budget can be done by keeping taxes low, promoting economic growth and cutting excessive waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, said Congressman Smith. "Reckless spending puts an undue burden on those who can least afford it -- hard-working Americans." The bill increases domestic spending, fails to protect Social Security and only reduces the alternative minimum tax for one year. The tax hikes include the following: - Increasing tax rates for middle-income Americans. - Increasing taxes paid on capital gains and dividends, harming savings for seniors. - Eliminating the State and local sales tax deduction. These tax hikes will have a major effect on families standard of living, said Smith. We should find alternative ways to balance the budget besides taxing middle income families. Smith was one of 209 Members of Congress to vote against this legislation that passed the House 214 to 209.
05.17.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today called the Senate immigration amnesty proposal a bad deal that puts short-term political interests ahead of the long-term interests of the American worker. This proposal would do lasting damage to the country, American workers, and the rule of law, stated Smith. Amnesty puts lawbreakers ahead of those who are law-abiding, puts foreign workers ahead of American workers, and encourages even more illegal immigration. Said Smith, The American people arent demanding amnesty, they are demanding border security. We need border security, but we dont need amnesty to secure the border. Just because someone is in the country illegally doesnt mean we have to give them citizenship, the greatest honor our country can bestow, Smith continued. Some want to sell citizenship to lawbreakers for the price of a fine. Amnesty treats illegal immigrants better than those who play by the rules and come in the right way, asserted Smith.
05.17.2007	The House Intellectual Property Subcommittee today approved Ranking Member Lamar Smiths (R-TX) bipartisan patent reform bill known as the Patent Reform Act of 2007 (H.R. 1908). The bipartisan bill, which Smith cosponsored with Chairman Howard Berman (D-CA), represents the biggest change to patent law since the 1952 Act was written. Few issues are as important to the economic strength of the United States as our ability to create and protect intellectual property, Smith explained. American IP industries account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of our economic growth and employ 18 million Americans. Strengthening intellectual property leads to economic growth, job creation and the type of creativity that has made America the envy of the world, he stated. Our goal is to help the small inventor toiling in his garage, the high-tech firm that files thousands of patents at a time and everyone in between. The Patent Reform Act implements a first-to-file standard consistent with international practice, creates a post-grant opposition system to weed out bad patents, clarifies how damages are determined in valid disputes, and reduces the number of frivolous lawsuits. Much of the current draft was written by Smith last year, when he was Chair of the House Intellectual Property Subcommittee. We will continue to fine-tune the bill as it moves through the legislative process, concluded Smith. Todays bipartisan support signals that Congress is serious about completing the job of patent reform we began last year. Smiths bill now goes to the full committee for consideration. Identical Senate legislation could move in the Senate this summer.
05.17.2007	The House Judiciary Committee today passed a lobbying reform bill similar to legislation Republicans passed on the House floor last year. The public wants and deserves open and honest government, asserted Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX). For the first time since Democrats took control of Congress, we will finally vote on a lobbying reform bill. If the bill seems familiar, it is, Smith stated. It is largely the same as the lobby disclosure provisions reported out of the Republican-led Judiciary Committee last Congress. Smith quoted Mark Twain saying, Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So Republicans should feel complimented. Virtually all of the provisions in todays bill were in the Republican bill passed by the House last Congress, including disclosure of Members private-sector employment negotiations, prohibition of threats by Members to influence private-sector employment, the creation of a public lobbying database with increased frequency of lobbying disclosure, and increased penalties for lobbyist disclosure violations. Last years Republican bill went further by including a moratorium on privately funded travel. It also required lobbyists to report their expenses more precisely. I am pleased Democrats are supporting many of our original recommendations, Smith asserted. This bill will make for more open and more responsive government.
05.16.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX) today called the Democrats lobbying reform bill a repeat of last years Republican-led provisions. Said Smith, The public wants and deserves clean government. For the first time since Democrats took control of Congress, we will finally vote on a lobbying reform bill. If the bill seems familiar, it is. It is largely the same as the lobby disclosure provisions reported out of the Republican-led Judiciary Committee last Congress.As Mark Twain said, ˜Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So Republicans should feel complimented. The Republican-drafted provisions in tomorrows legislation include a requirement for additional quarterly disclosures by lobbyists, disclosure of the names of federal candidates and their leadership PACS and disclosure of payments for events honoring Members. It also includes disclosure of payments to entities named for Members, disclosure of payments made to entities established and controlled by Members, and disclosure of payments for retreats and conferences that benefit of Members.Last years effort also required lobbyists to report their expenses more precisely and that the Clerk of the House link lobbying disclosure reports to relevant FEC filings on the Internet. In addition, it included provisions providing for criminal penalties of up to 3 years in jail for knowing and willful failures to comply, and for up to 5 years for knowing, willful, and corrupt failures to comply. I am pleased Democrats chose to take up many of our original recommendations, Smith commented. This bill will make for more open and more responsive government.
05.15.2007	A law enforcement funding bill cosponsored by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) was approved by the House of Representatives today. The COPS bill (H.R. 1700) is a product of the House Judiciary Committee, for which Smith serves as Ranking Member. Americas local law enforcement agencies are on the front lines combating and preventing crime every day, stated Ranking Member Smith. Their dedication, service and innovative policing programs led to a 34 percent decrease in violent crime over the past 10 years. The COPS program, originally enacted in 1994, provides grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to hire police officers and purchase new crime-fighting technology. The program ensures grant money is not used to replace state or local funding, but to increase funds for community policing. Todays vote coincides with National Police Week in Washington, D.C. Thousands of police officers from across the country, including many from Texas, are in the nations capital to memorialize fallen officers. Criminals today are smarter and better equipped than ever before, explained Smith. This funding helps our police match them person for person, dollar for dollar and technology for technology. We owe our police at least that much. The bill passed the House of Representatives today with broad, bipartisan support and is now headed to the Senate for consideration.
05.10.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted for the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act (H.R. 1873). The bill expands small business opportunities in the federal marketplace. Small business play a vital role in our local economy and this bill provides added protection in safeguarding our small businesses, said Congressman Smith. This bill provides small businesses with more opportunity to compete for federal contracts. Government agencies will no longer be able to bundle small contracts into a single large one and this will allow smaller businesses the opportunity to attain more contracts. More competition for these federal contracts will result in lower prices and higher quality and that benefits everyone, said Smith. I will continue to support and promote small businesses and a pro-economic growth agenda.
05.09.2007	Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (TX-21), along with a group of his congressional colleagues, sent a letter to all Members of the Senate urging them to reject any bill that grants amnesty to illegal immigrants. We need border security, but we dont need amnesty to secure the border, stated Ranking Member Smith. Senate leaders have made it clear they plan to bring comprehensive immigration reform legislation to the floor this month. News reports indicate the proposal could legalize most of the estimated 12 to 20 million illegal immigrants now in the United States. The letter was signed by other high-ranking Republican committee leaders, including Homeland Security Ranking Member, Peter King (R-NY), Immigration Subcommittee Ranking Member Ranking Member, Steve King (R-IA), Immigration Reform Committee Chair Brian Bilbray (R-CA) and Terrorism Subcommittee Ranking Member Ed Royce (R-CA). There is a common sense definition of amnesty: it occurs when someone in the country illegally, instead of being deported, is rewarded by being legalized and allowed to stay, Smith explained. Added Smith, Just because someone is in the country illegally doesnt mean we have to give them citizenship, the greatest honor our country can bestow. Some want to sell citizenship to lawbreakers for the price of a fine. Congressman Smiths letter contained clear message lawmakers in the Senate: the closer you move toward amnesty, the further away you move from the American public and your House colleagues. Amnesty puts lawbreakers ahead of those who are law abiding, puts foreign workers ahead of American workers, and encourages even more illegal immigration, concluded Smith. Amnesty treats illegal immigrants better than those who play by the rules and come in the right way.
05.02.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) held a telephone town meeting last night from his office in Washington, D.C. He spoke with constituents in Bandera, Comal, Kendall, Kerr and Real counties for more than an hour.This is an excellent way for me to reach out to my constituents and hear about issues important to them, said Congressman Smith. We discussed subjects ranging from illegal immigration, to Iraq, to border security.The telephone town meeting enables calls to be placed to registered voters. Live polls also were conducted during the call. One of the questions asked was, Do you think local law enforcement officials should be able to enforce immigration laws? 90% of callers said yes, local law enforcement officials should be able to enforce immigration laws, 8% said no and 2% had no opinion. Another question asked was, How would you rate the telephone town meeting? 95% of callers said it was helpful and informative, 3% said it wasnt and 2% had no opinion.These telephone town meetings enable me to stay in touch with the people I serve, said Smith.
04.30.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) and fellow Austin Congressman Michael McCaul (TX-10) today introduced bipartisan legislation for increasing the use of plug-in hybrid vehicles. The Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Act of 2007 will encourage the production and create awareness of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Americans are concerned about high gas prices, our dependence on foreign oil and global warming, said Congressman Smith. Plug-in hybrid cars have the potential to address all three problems. "This is the kind of common sense legislation the Congress and nation need to support," stated Congressman Michael McCaul (R-Texas). He went on to say, "From reasons ranging from national security to our environment, the United States must cut back on its dependence on foreign oil and find new and better ways to sustain our nation's need for power. I thank Congressman Smith for this legislation and for his leadership efforts on this important issue." The legislation proposes $250 million in annual funding (2008-2012) for research and development of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Additionally, the legislation calls for $50 million in annual funding (2008-2012) to carry out a pilot program for deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles. A plug-in vehicle may be driven up to 100 miles using one gallon of gas and may achieve nearly zero emissions during stop-and-go driving, said Smith. Other co-sponsors of the bill include; Rep. Judy Biggert (R-IL), Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Rep. Vernon Ehlers (R-MI), and Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). The proposed legislation offers grants to state and local authorities to help them acquire plug-in hybrid vehicles. These grants will be used to carry out demonstrations and commercial applications of plug-in vehicles. The Austin City Council and Austin Energy are leading a national campaign called Plug-In Partners to demonstrate to automakers that a market exists today for plug-in hybrids. They are enlisting other cities to join their call for the production of plug-in hybrid cars. More than 500 entities representing 41 states have joined the Plug-In Partners campaign. This legislation allows Austin and other cities to establish a partnership to focus on plug-in hybrid technology, concluded Smith.
04.27.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) will introduce legislation on Monday for increasing the use of plug-in hybrid vehicles. The Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Act of 2007 will encourage the production and create awareness of plug-in hybrid vehicles. A plug-in hybrid vehicle may be driven up to 100 miles using one gallon of gas, said Congressman Smith. For economic, environmental and strategic reasons, it makes sense to encourage automakers to go beyond their already popular hybrid vehicles to produce plug-in cars. The legislation proposes $250 million in annual funding (2008-2012) for research and development of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Additionally, the legislation calls for $50 million in annual funding (2008-2012) to carry out a pilot program for deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Batteries in conventional hybrid cars recharge by capturing energy released during braking or through a generator attached to the combustion engine, said Smith. Plug-in hybrids offer the additional option of recharging batteries by plugging the vehicle into an electrical outlet. The proposed legislation offers grants to state and local authorities to help them acquire plug-in hybrid vehicles. These grants will be used to carry out demonstrations and commercial applications of plug-in vehicles. The Austin City Council and Austin Energy are leading a national campaign called Plug-In Partners to demonstrate to automakers that a market exists today for plug-in hybrids. They are enlisting other cities to join their call for the production of plug-in hybrid cars. More than 500 entities representing 41 states have joined the Plug-In Partners campaign. "Plug-in hybrids represent one of the best near-term solutions to America's over-reliance on foreign oil," Austin Mayor Will Wynn said. "They can also be an important strategy in solving our urban air quality problems and in dealing with the growing threat of climate change. I'm proud of Austin's role in demonstrating the market demand for these products through our Plug-In Partners Campaign, and I know Congressman Smith's legislation will expand that market further still." Austin is setting an example for the rest of the nation through its support for plug-in hybrid cars, concluded Smith. This legislation allows Austin and other cities to establish a partnership to focus on plug-in hybrid technology.
04.20.2007	The Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement held its first public hearing pledging to find workable solutions on ethics reform. I thank everyone who took time out of their busy schedules to share their thoughts on ethics reform with the task force. We received a great deal of thoughtful and compelling testimony that will be carefully considered as the task force deliberates in the weeks ahead, stated Congressman Mike Capuano.The charge of this task force is to recommend ways to improve the ethics process. But no matter what procedures are put in place governing ethics investigations of Members of Congress, there will always be a few bad apples in a much larger barrel, said Congressman Lamar Smith. Our charge here is to determine how to help separate out the few bad apples without upsetting the whole applecart.A second public hearing will be held in the next two weeks to hear testimony from former Members. The task force has held 11 official meetings and will report its conclusions back to the House.In January House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Rep.

04.18.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) has joined the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press. The bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press was established in May 2006. The caucus aims to combat and condemn media censorship and the persecution of journalists around the world. There are more than 20 Members on the caucus. Freedom of the press is one of the foundations for a democratic society and needs to be protected, said Congressman Smith. The caucus seeks to raise awareness of free press issues “ predominantly international free press “ by drafting letters to heads of state and convening events with press freedom advocates. In the coming year, the caucus hopes to host workshops where special guests will brief Members and staff on international free press issues. As President Thomas Jefferson said, The only security of all is in a free press.

03.21.2007	The United States House of Representatives today approved a bill cosponsored by Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Lamar Smith (R-TX). The bill is the Judicial Disclosure Responsibility Act (H.R. 1130), which will help protect judges, their family members and other courthouse personnel by preventing disclosure of personal information that can be used to target and retaliate against members of our judiciary. This legislation extends the authority of federal judges and court personnel to redact sensitive and personal information from financial disclosure reports for security reasons. The current authority to redact personal and sensitive information from financial disclosure reports expired at the end of last year. Recent assaults and threats against federal judges and their family members demonstrate the need for this redaction authority to continue, explained Smith. I believe this is an important safeguard to prevent vindictive offenders and litigants from seeking their revenge by harming or intimidating judges, probation officers, and others.
03.20.2007	The Sunshine in Government Initiative (SGI), today honored Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) with a Sunshine Award for his commitment and work to strengthen open government and make more information available to the public.I want to thank SGI for this honor, said Congressman Smith. The ability to obtain records from the government is one of the fundamental rights of the American people.Each recipient contributes significantly to the publics understanding of open government laws and serves in government making current, concrete and oftentimes unrecognized contributions to protecting or strengthening open government, SGI said.SGI presented the award to Smith and four other Members of Congress. This is the first time that SGI has given this award.The public should have the opportunity to obtain information quickly and easily from the federal government and I will continue to work for that result, said Smith.
03.09.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith has notified Trinity University that they have been awarded a $261,154 grant through the National Science Foundation. The funds will be used for the project, called, Trinity University Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Mathematics. The program will allow the mathematics department at Trinity University to continue their Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematics Program. This federal award will provide students with knowledge and experience in the field of mathematics, Smith said, The program will develop students skills in mathematical writing and research. "Receipt of this National Science Foundation grant will continue the tradition of academic excellence of Trinity's mathematics department and the mathematics education we offer our students, University of Trinity President John R. Brazil said. More than 2,600 students attend Trinity University, which offers 37 majors and 13 interdisciplinary minors. Under the leadership of Professor Scott Chapman, this program has been in place every summer since 1997, attracting gifted student mathematicians from across the United States. Dr. Chapman and the mathematics department have a strong commitment to summer research, and this program has resulted in the publication of numerous scholarly papers," Brazil said. This federal assistance program demonstrates a commitment by the federal government to provide students with the tools they need to learn. Smith concluded.
03.06.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) has introduced the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007, which improves public access to information by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This bill makes it easier for citizens to get an answer to their requests for information, Congressman Smith said. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining government information is overly burdensome and federal agencies have become less and less responsive to requests for information, Smith noted. This deters the citizens from getting information to which they are entitled. Taxpayers should have the opportunity to obtain information quickly and easily from the federal government, said Smith The OPEN Act does the following: - Creates a broader definition of news media so that additional types of news media can obtain government documents at minimal cost. - Establishes a system that assigns individualized tracking numbers to requests for information so individuals can track their own requests. - Includes provisions regarding recovery of attorneys fees when an individual has been wrongly denied information, penalties for agencies that do not comply within the specified FOIA time limits, and additional agency reporting requirements. I want to protect our open system of government and ensure that the government responds to the American people, Smith concluded.

02.25.2007	Sundays implosion of the Intel building shell marks an explosive kick-off to the development of the western part of downtown Austin, Congressman Lamar Smith said. The new Federal Courthouse to be located at the old Intel site is in the 21st Congressional District which Smith represents. The new courthouse, Smith said, will start the next phase of Austins vibrant downtown growth with an impressive exclamation point. The demolition and site preparation for the new courthouse was made possible by $3 million in funding secured in 2005 by Smith with support from other members of the Travis County Congressional Delegation.Austin city officials had sought the funding to rid the downtown area of the abandoned Intel building shell and replace it with a new Federal Courthouse. The citys goal of replacing a remnant of the high-tech downturn with a major new federal investment to kick-start development on the west side of downtown is being realized even before construction on the new courthouse has begun, Smith said, citing construction projects already under way and planned in the area. Smith, the senior member of the Travis County Congressional delegation, said he and Congressmen Lloyd Doggett and Michael McCaul would continue to work to assure that the construction timetable for the new Federal Courthouse is met.
02.22.2007	U.S. Representative Lamar Smith has reopened his Kerrville Congressional District Office after the recent redrawing of Congressional District boundaries. The constituent service office is at 301 Junction Highway, Suite 346C. Smith had maintained an office in the Hill Country from 1987, when he became a Member of Congress, through 2004 when the redrawing of Congressional boundaries moved the Hill Country outside of the 21st Congressional District. The United States Supreme Court last year ordered new lines drawn that returned the Hill Country counties of Kerr, Kendall, Bandera and Real to the 21st Congressional District. Its nice to be back, Smith said. And its a privilege to represent the good people of the Hill Country.

02.12.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) voted today to honor the 98th Anniversary of the NAACP.House Concurrent Resolution 44 acknowledged the anniversary of the founding of the NAACP.For almost a century, the NAACP has fought to bring justice and racial equality to all parts of America. Smith commented, The history of Americas modern struggle to live up to our constitutional principles was often written by the NAACP, and it continues to champion the cause of social justice today. The NAACP has served as the voice of those who were mute with fear. It has served as a key for those who were handcuffed and jailed under segregationist policies. And it carried the weight for those whose backs were broken by brutal beatings.It did so peacefully, and with dignity, and as a result America can hold its head higher. It is with great pleasure that I support this concurrent resolution, which I hope raises even higher the awareness of this organizations historic contributions to the cause of civil rights, Smith said.

01.31.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) took his seat as the top-ranking Republican at the first Judiciary Committee hearing of the 110th Congress. In this hearing, Smith took issue with the Democrats criticism of presidential signing statements.I look forward to leading the other Republican members on the committee to advance legislation that keeps our economy strong and upholds our constitutional rights, Smith said. Im on this committee to look out for the rights of the people of the 21st District when it comes to issues like crime, immigration and court procedures.Smith has been a member of the House Judiciary Committee since 1987 and is the first Texan to be named Republican Ranking Member on the committee.
01.31.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith voted no today on the Democrats continuing resolution (H.J. Res. 20) in order to protect funding for vital local programs.Unfortunately, this legislation slashes valuable funding and eliminates jobs, Smith said.Here are a few of the programs in Smiths district that will lose federal funds. In the San Antonio area:¢ Millions in new funding for Fort Sam Houston and other San Antonio military bases;¢ Hundreds of thousands in funding for a bus system and pedestrian bridge on the River Walk; and¢ Funding for energy and water programs for the San Antonio Channel Improvement Project.In the Austin area:¢ Funding for two new Capitol Metro park-and-rides that would have expanded the services to more residents and provided access to downtown; and¢ $1 million in construction of an Interstate 35 park-and-ride facility that would have connected South Austin with downtown.The Democrats arent fixing the problems “ theyre causing more, Smith said. These types of losses affect the community and local economy and the reverberations will be felt throughout the region for years to come.
01.12.2007	President Bush today signed into law Congressman Lamar Smiths (TX-21) Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 4709), which protects citizens privacy by criminalizing the fraudulent sale or solicitation of confidential phone records. Selling or buying a persons phone records without permission invades their privacy, said Congressman Smith. This invasion of privacy can adversely affect Americans lives, Smith explained. These records can reveal details of our medical or financial life. The records can identify our occupation or physical location “ a serious concern for undercover police officers and victims of stalking or domestic violence. The law creates new penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 for any person who sells, transfers, purchases or receives confidential phone records without the consent of the phone customer. The activity has been linked to identity theft and has become a money-making scam. Individuals who pose as phone company representatives or customers falsely obtain access to customer records. Some companies even established a presence on the Internet, advertising the ability to obtain private personal cell phone and landline calling records for as little as $100. Sales of fraudulently obtained phone records flourished because the possibility of criminal prosecution was remote, concluded Smith. The law sends a strong message to data thieves - this activity will not be tolerated.
01.10.2007	Republican congressional leaders today announced that Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) will serve on the Judiciary, Homeland Security and Science Committees. In addition, Congressman Smith was chosen to serve as his partys leader on the Judiciary Committee. I will use my position on these committees to advance legislation that makes our country safer, creates jobs, and improves our schools, said Congressman Smith. The people of the 21st District have a voice on these committees.Congressman Smith is the first Texan to be named Republican Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee. In this new role, Smith will serve as a spokesman for the Republican Caucus and will help shape the partys policy on issues before the committee. The committee is made up of 17 Republicans and 23 Democrats. He will oversee a staff of 25. Congressman Smith has been a member of the House Judiciary Committee since 1987. He has served as Chairman of three of the committees five subcommittees: Intellectual Property, Crime and Immigration. Former Judiciary committee leaders include Daniel Webster and James Buchanan, who went on to become President. The five subcommittees that make up the House Judiciary Committee have jurisdiction over court procedures, intellectual property, crime, the Constitution, immigration, bankruptcy, antitrust, and administrative law, explained Congressman Smith. The committees jurisdiction reaches into every aspect of society; from the economy to our constitutional rights. The House Homeland Security Committee initiates laws that govern the war on terror. The House Science and Technology Committee has jurisdiction over Americas space program, energy and environmental research. Committee assignments are chosen by the House Republican Conference and by the House Republican Steering Committee, which consists of 33 Representatives from across the country, including elected House Republican leaders. "I look forward to debating and passing legislation that is good for our nation and benefits the American people, concluded Smith.
01.09.2007	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today continued his efforts to save local military funding by urging support for H.R. 22. This legislation would prevent San Antonio military bases from losing over $126 million in new funding. The bill calls for passage of the Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Act at fully authorized funding levels. The Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Act was one of nine appropriations bills that did not clear the previous Congress last year.We cannot continue to fund military construction and base operations at fiscal year 2006 levels, explained Congressman Smith, who represents Fort Sam Houston. Outdated funding levels will not address the new and growing needs of our local military installations. Democrat leaders presiding over the 110th Congress have indicated that they will rely on a continuing resolution at fiscal year 2006 levels to finance most government operations through the remainder of fiscal 2007, which ends September 30, while they craft appropriations bills for 2008.As a result of base consolidation, Fort Sam Houston is due to receive 11,000 new military personnel starting in 2007. Fort Sam and San Antonios other military bases must have adequate funds to absorb thousands of new people and successfully complete the Base Realignment and Closure transition, said Smith. I am reaching out to other Members of the Texas delegation to urge their support to correct this potential funding crisis. The Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Act contains over $154 million for three San Antonio military installations: Fort Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base and Randolph Air Force Base. This funding will provide local military personnel with the medical education, training, health care and quality of life they need to accomplish their missions at home and abroad, concluded Smith. I will continue to make every effort to ensure that our San Antonio military bases receive the amount of funding they need to protect our country.
12.08.2006	The Senate tonight unanimously approved Congressman Lamar Smiths (TX-21) Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 4709), which protects citizens privacy by criminalizing the fraudulent sale or solicitation of confidential phone records. Smiths bill passed the House last April by a vote of 409 to 0. Selling or buying a persons phone records without permission invades their privacy, said Congressman Smith. This data fraud can adversely affect Americans lives, Smith explained. A careful study of these records may reveal details of our medical or financial life. It may even identify our occupation or physical location “ a serious concern for undercover police officers and victims of stalking or domestic violence.The legislation creates new penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 for any person who sells, transfers, purchases or receives confidential phone records without the consent of the phone customer. The activity has been linked to identity theft and has become a money-making scam. Individuals who pose as phone company representatives or customers falsely obtain access to customer records. Some companies even established a presence on the Internet, advertising the ability to obtain private personal cell phone and landline calling records for as little as $100.Sales of fraudulently obtained phone records flourished because the possibility of criminal prosecution was remote, concluded Smith. The bills unanimous support in both houses sends a strong message to data thieves - this activity will not be tolerated. The bill now heads to the Presidents desk for his signature.
12.06.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) today was chosen to lead House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. In his new role as Ranking Member, Congressman Smith will be the first Texan to hold that position. The five subcommittees that make up the House Judiciary Committee have jurisdiction over court procedures, intellectual property, crime, the Constitution, immigration, bankruptcy, antitrust, and administrative law, explained Congressman Smith. As Ranking Member, Congressman Smith will serve as a spokesman for the Republican Party and is responsible for forming the partys policy on issues before the Committee. He will oversee a staff of 25. Congressman Smith said, I look forward to debating and passing legislation that is good for our nation and benefits the American people.The Ranking Member is chosen by the House Republican Steering Committee, which consists of 33 Representatives from across the country, including elected House Republican leaders. The Steering Committees selection will be ratified by all House Republicans, a formality expected to happen on Thursday. Congressman Smith has been a member of the House Judiciary Committee since 1987. He has served as Chairman of three of the five subcommittees: Intellectual Property, Crime and Immigration.
10.19.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today asked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (CPB) to extend San Antonio International Airports (SAIA) designated port of entry status. The status, which applies to private aircraft, expires in November. Without port of entry status, many international flights into San Antonio may be diverted, explained Congressman Smith. SAIA, which is located in the 21st Congressional District, was designated as a U.S. port of entry in 2001 through Congressional action. Congress acted again in 2004 by extending the designation to November 2006. Said Smith, I am concerned that allowing this designation to lapse will have a significant, adverse economic impact on San Antonio. In a letter to the CPB Commissioner, Congressman Smith requested a six-month extension of the port of entry designation for SAIA. Such an extension gives Congress time to consider an additional long-term extension. It also allows CBP time to grant a permanent designation to SAIA. I will work to secure permanent designation that will provide economic certainty and expand trade between the U.S. and Mexico, pledged Congressman Smith.
10.18.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today asked the Administration to increase annual funding for the United States Army. In a letter to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congressman Smith pointed out that Fort Sam Houston, which is located in the 21st Congressional District, was unable to pay its utility bill for three months. I am concerned by the lack of support for base operations at Fort Sam Houston, said Congressman Smith. The financial constraints at Fort Sam have a real impact on military personnel and their families.As a result of base consolidation, Fort Sam Houston is due to receive 11,000 new Army personnel starting in 2007. Smith explained, Fort Sam must have adequate funds to absorb thousands of new people and successfully complete the BRAC transition. In June, the Army notified Congressman Smith of a significant shortfall in base installation funding. The shortfall resulted in widespread media accounts detailing the financial constraints at Army bases across the country. The constraints resulted in cancellation of contracts and discontinuation of services such as lawn maintenance and utilities. Even after the emergency supplemental spending bill passed Congress this fall, the Army determined there would be a $530 million deficit for base operations, including a $26 million shortfall for Fort Sam Houston.Over the last several months I have corresponded with the Secretary of the Army and visited Fort Sam to learn as much as I can about the effects of the funding shortfall.We must ensure this unacceptable situation does not occur again in the future. I have asked that the Administration increase the Armys budget so that it can fully meet all of its critical missions both at home and abroad, concluded Smith.
09.29.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted for the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R.5122). The bill provides pay raises for military personnel and body armor for troops in combat. It also protects TRICARE beneficiaries from premium increases. "Americas military families sacrifice to protect our freedom, said Congressman Smith. They deserve affordable health care and increased pay." Smith explained, The funding in this bill is the least we can do to demonstrate our gratitude to our men and women in uniform. The bill authorizes $462.8 billion in appropriations for the Department of Defense and national security programs at the Department of Energy. It includes the following: A 2.2% pay raise for all members of the armed forces; An increase in funding to provide troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with armored Humvees, interceptor body armor and improvised explosive device (IED) protection equipment; $50 billion in supplemental funding to support the Global War on Terrors operational costs, personnel expenses and procurement of new equipment; A provision that blocks the DODs proposed TRICARE fee increase until October 2007; and Prohibits an increase in co-payments for pharmaceuticals dispensed through the TRICARE retail pharmacy during fiscal year 2007. I will continue working to ensure our military personnel receive the health care they were promised, concluded Smith. Upon approval by the Senate, the bill will go to the Presidents desk for his signature.
09.29.2006	The House of Representatives today approved the Alternative Energy Research and Development Act (H.R. 6203). The bipartisan bill contained solar energy and plug-in hybrid vehicle initiatives Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) introduced in June. Americans are concerned about high gas prices, our dependence on foreign oil and global warming, said Smith. This bill addresses those concerns and improves our energy security, national security and environmental security. The Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Act contained in the legislation establishes a partnership between private and public entities to focus on electric drive technology. It requires the Secretary of Energy to carry out a program of research and development for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric drive transportation technology. The goal is to develop a plug-in hybrid car that can travel up to 40 miles on battery power alone. The bill also establishes a pilot program of grants to local governments and metropolitan transportation authorities. These grants support local projects that demonstrate the need for, and practicality of, plug-in hybrid electric technology.The SUN Act of 2006, which is also contained in the bill, aims to make electricity from solar power cost-competitive by 2015. A recent Energy Foundation study suggests that the U.S. could produce 2,900 new megawatts of solar power by 2010 -- enough to power 500,000 homes -- if the cost is significantly reduced.The SUN Act encourages state governments and private industry to team up to apply for federal grants for solar panel technology to be installed, for example, in public buildings or housing developments. The more this type of technology is used, the cheaper it will become. Other nations that have promoted solar energy found that efficiency of production and installation increased as the technology became more commonplace. The answer to many of our energy needs comes up every morning, explained Smith. Solar power is clean, plentiful and generates zero emissions and zero waste. Smith concluded, Congress has a responsibility to help promote alternative energy technology. The bills were included in a comprehensive package of energy-related legislation. The package contains other innovative energy provisions, such as programs to promote the use of bio-fuel and programs to promote construction of energy efficient buildings. The legislation now heads to the Senate for consideration.
09.27.2006	A House subcommittee today approved Congressman Lamar Smiths (TX-21) Open Government Act (H.R. 867). The legislation improves public access to information by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) is the bills sponsor in the Senate. The Freedom of Information Act performs a vital check on the federal branch. It protects our open system of government and ensures that the government responds to the American people, said Congressman Smith. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining government information is overly burdensome and federal agencies have become less and less responsive to requests for information, Smith noted. This deters citizens from seeking information. Taxpayers should be able to obtain information quickly and easily. This legislation will greatly improve the publics right to know what the government is doing in their name, said Smith.The bill does the following: Creates a broader definition of news media so that all types of news media, including smaller, non-traditional outlets, can obtain government documents at minimal cost; Allows more individuals to recover attorneys fees when they are on the winning side of litigation to get information from the government;Tightens up time limits for government agencies to respond to FOIA requests;Requires government agencies to implement a system that enables individuals to track their request for information; and Creates a new Office of Government Information Services to ensure that FOIA requests in all government agencies are promptly and thoroughly handled.I am encouraged by todays developments and hope to see the bill approved by the full House soon, concluded Smith.
09.27.2006	Congress last night approved a Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 5631), which contained $2.3 million for local military projects. The funding was requested and secured by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21).This funding allows the military to develop the best equipment that technology has to offer, explained Congressman Smith. Our region is supporting major advances in military technology. The research being done here today will support military efforts across the globe for years to come. The bill includes: $1.3 million for a research and development project led by Applied Physical Electronics (APELC) of Austin. APELC makes generators that run on compact impulse technology used in missile defense. The funding is part of the Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research Program; and $1 million for a program to help make Navy ships blast resistant. The program is being conducted by the Texas Research Institute in conjunction with the Department of the Navy Science and Corporate Board. This Austin-based project develops blast resistant coating that will help Navy vessels withstand enemy fire. The legislation now heads to the Presidents desk for his signature.
09.27.2006	Congress last night approved a Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 5631), which contained $4 million for local military projects. The funding was requested and secured by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). This funding allows the military to develop the best equipment and medical care that technology has to offer, explained Congressman Smith. Our region is supporting major advances in military technology. The research being done here today will support military efforts across the globe for years to come. The bill includes: $3 million for a nation-wide research program called FIRST, or Functionally Integrated Reactive Surface Technologies. It has yet to be determined how much funding would be allotted to South West Research Institute in San Antonio, which is a partner in the program. The program develops special tools for soldiers and first responders that can withstand biological or chemical attack. The surface reactive technologies would be able to detect and automatically ameliorate radiological, biological or chemical agents; and $1 million to fund a research partnership between Brooke Army Medical Center and the University of Texas and (UT-BAMC). UT-BAMC oversees a trauma and burn center called the Trauma Institute of San Antonio (TRISTAT). TRISTAT cares for over 8,000 trauma victims across South Texas and has been an important training and research center for medical personnel serving in Iraq.The legislation now heads to the Presidents desk for his signature.
09.21.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in favor of two bills designed to uphold Americas immigration laws and protect communities from dangerous criminals. We have a responsibility to make sure the laws of this land protect Americans, said Smith. The legislation approved today ensures that both local and federal law enforcement officials have the authority they need to arrest and detain illegal immigrants. Under current law, illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes often cannot be deported. One example is when their home country refuses to take them back. In that case, the Supreme Court has ruled that these convicted criminals cannot be detained indefinitely and must be released. The Community Protection Act of 2006 (H.R. 6094) fixes this legal loophole by allowing the federal government to detain illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes for six month periods beyond their original imprisonment.The second bill, the Immigration Law Enforcement Act of 2006, (H.R. 6095) reaffirms the authority of state and local law enforcement officials to voluntarily investigate and hold illegal immigrants. For instance, a police officer might stop an individual and find out that the individual is in the United States illegally. Its contrary to common sense that the police officer would not be able to arrest that person. This bill would allow local law enforcement officials to cooperate with Border Patrol. Smith commented, Local police officers had stopped four of the 9/11 terrorists for speeding. Had those officers checked their immigration status, we might have prevented the 9/11 attacks. The bills passed today keep dangerous people off our streets, concluded Smith.
09.14.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act (H.R. 6061). Smith is an original co-sponsor of the legislation, which aims to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States. The unending flow of people into our country threatens our national security, said Smith. If we are to prevent another 9/11, we must establish complete control of our borders and ports.The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to prevent all illegal entry into the United States within 18 months of enactment by using technological and physical infrastructures.It builds on policies enacted in Smiths 1996 immigration bill, which led to the construction of a fence along the California-Mexico border. This legislation authorizes construction of an additional 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing along the southwest border. The fence will be built first in highly populated areas.The legislation also mandates that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through a virtual fence by using cameras, ground sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles. It requires DHS provide all necessary authority to border personnel who are following fleeing vehicles. This is similar to the authority held by the United States Coast Guard for maritime vessels. Anything less leaves our country more vulnerable to terrorist attack and leaves our citizens and legal immigrants paying the welfare, education, healthcare and other costs associated with illegal immigration, concluded Smith.
09.14.2006	The House of Representatives today passed ethics reform legislation aimed at increasing public scrutiny of spending measures known as earmarks. A number of abuses have come to the surface, said Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). The House of Representatives must clean up its own act. The integrity of the House must be protected. Both parties recognize we need to make changes, said Smith. The good I hope will come from these scandals is greater scrutiny of the conduct of Members of Congress and greater public accountability of lobbying activities. Congressman Smith, a senior member of the House Ethics Committee and its former Chairman, called for Members of Congress to publicly identify themselves and justify their spending requests. House Resolution 1000 requires congressional committees to attach a list of earmarks and their sponsors to each bill. Also, when the House and Senate agree on a piece of legislation, a list of any earmarks added during that negotiation process must be included in the bill before the House votes on it. This change in procedure will bring greater transparency to the legislative process, ensuring that Members of Congress are held accountable for their requests, explained Smith. Not all spending requests are bad, but by making these earmarks public, we can reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending.Smith has long pushed for ethics reform. As a freshman Congressman, he introduced the Ethics in Congress Act that led to a one-year ban on lobbying by departing Members of Congress and senior staff. He also sponsored the Government-wide Ethics Act of 1989 and co-sponsored the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995.
08.09.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) Tuesday announced the award of $147,887 in federal funds to San Antonios Boysville Inc., for a program preventing juvenile delinquency that will serve 100 Boysville children each day.Boysville is in Converse in the 21st Congressional District which Smith serves.For 63 years, Boysville has provided a secure and hopeful environment for children who previously knew abuse, neglect or abandonment, Smith said. These federal funds will enable Boysville to continue to focus on its goal of helping children to become responsible adults.The federal dollars, which Smith secured through the congressional appropriations process for the Department of Justices Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Program, will fund independent living courses for middle and high school students that will emphasize school attendance and performance and healthy family relationships.Ed Baxter, Boysvilles Director of Development and Finance, said the new program will provide children with better tools to prepare themselves to be independent, contributing adults. Boysville works to break the cycle of abuse and neglect and educate our children to become good citizens, Baxter said.Programs such as this are an investment in our children and in their futures, Baxter said. We appreciate Congressman Smiths efforts on behalf of Boysville and his belief in the young people who live and learn here.
06.27.2006	The House Science Committee today approved two energy bills sponsored by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). The Solar Utilization Now Act of 2006 (SUN Act) and the Plug-In Hybrid Electrical Vehicle Act of 2006 provide federal grants to promote development and use of cleaner burning, reliable energy. Americans are concerned about high gas prices, our dependence on foreign oil and global warming, said Congressman Smith. These bills have the potential to alleviate all three problems.Said Smith, Through federal grants the ˜SUN Act and the ˜Plug-In Hybrid Electrical Vehicle Act will encourage development and use of cleaner burning fuels. If we harness the power of renewable energy we can put America on a path toward energy independence. The SUN Act (H.R. 5594) is essential because part of the answer to our energy needs comes up every morning. Solar power is clean, plentiful and generates zero emissions and zero waste. The bill encourages state governments and private industry to team up to apply for federal grants. Under Smiths bill, states are required to contribute at least 10 percent of the funding. The federal government matches the grant at a maximum of 40 percent. The rest would come from utilities or private industry. The programs funding starts with $50 million in the first year (2007) and ramps up to $300 million in 2011. The Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Act (H.R. 5538) establishes a partnership between private and public entities to focus on electric drive technology. The legislation offers $250 million in annual funding (2007-2016) for research and development of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Additionally, the legislation calls for $50 million in annual funding (2007-2016) to carry out a pilot program for deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles.The legislation is good for our energy security, national security and environmental security, concluded Smith. The bills were included in a comprehensive package of energy-related legislation known as the Energy Research, Development, Demonstration and Commercial Application Act of 2006 (H.R. 5656). The package contains other innovative energy provisions, such as programs to promote the use of bio-fuel and programs to promote construction of energy efficient buildings. The legislation is expected to be voted on by the full House in July.
06.21.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) has secured over $5 million in federal funding for local military projects. The funding obtained by Smith was included in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 5631) approved by the U.S. House of Representatives last night. This funding allows the military to develop the best equipment and medical care that technology has to offer, explained Congressman Smith. Our region is supporting major advances in bio and electronic technology. The research being done here today will support military efforts across the globe for years to come. The bill includes: $1 million to fund a research partnership between the University of Texas and Brooke Army Medical Center (UT-BAMC). UT-BAMC oversees a trauma and burn center called the Trauma Institute of San Antonio (TRISTAT). TRISTAT cares for over 8,000 trauma victims across South Texas and has been an important training and research center for medical personnel serving in Iraq. $2.5 million for a research and development project led by Applied Physical Electronics (APELC) of Austin. APELC makes generators that run on compact impulse technology used in missile defense. The funding is part of the Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research Program. $1.5 million for a program to help make Navy ships blast resistant. The program is being conducted by the Texas Research Institute in conjunction with the Department of the Navy Science and Corporate Board. This Austin-based project develops blast resistant coating that will help Navy vessels withstand enemy fire. $3 million for a nation-wide research program called FIRST, or Functionally Integrated Reactive Surface Technologies. It has yet to be determined how much funding would be allotted to South West Research Institute in San Antonio, which is a partner in the program. The program develops special tools for soldiers and first responders that can withstand biological or chemical attack. The surface reactive technologies would be able to detect and automatically ameliorate radiological, biological or chemical agents. The legislation will be reconciled with the United States Senates defense funding bill before heading to the Presidents desk for signature.
06.14.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) secured $2 million in federal funding for Austin-area transportation projects. The funding Smith obtained was included in the Transportation Appropriations Act of 2006 (H.R. 5576), which passed the United States House of Representatives today. Austin is growing, and our public transportation systems must grow with it, said Congressman Smith. This money will be used to expand the citys bus system to surrounding communities, he explained. The bill contains $1 million for construction of a park-and-ride bus facility in Oak Hill. This project will help anchor Cap Metros rapid bus services into Southwest Austin and Travis County. The new facility and bus routs will connect outlying neighborhoods with the downtown area.The bill also contains $1 million for construction of an I-35 park-and-ride facility. This project will connect neighborhoods in far South Austin with downtown.This brings the total transportation funding Smith has secured for Austin this Congress to $17 million. This funding is an investment in Austins future, concluded Smith. It will help Austin residents get around more quickly and easily. The legislation will be reconciled with the United States Senates transportation funding bill before heading to the Presidents desk for signature.
06.14.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) secured $500,000 in federal funding for San Antonio transportation improvement projects. The funding Smith obtained was included the Transportation Appropriations Act of 2006 (H.R. 5576), which passed the United States House of Representatives today. San Antonio is growing into a world class destination for tourism and business, said Smith. Our transportation infrastructure must grow with it. This money will help modernize the citys bus system and build a pedestrian walkway to carry visitors from hotels to the River Walk, he explained. The bill contains $400,000 to upgrade the Metropolitan Transit Systems vehicle maintenance facility and modernize their bus fare collection system. The agencys maintenance and operations facility was built in 1948, and it needs new technology to help it deal with the expanded bus fleet. The bill also contains $100,000 for construction of a pedestrian bridge to span the San Antonio River east of the Plaza. The bridge project is overseen by the City of San Antonio and will link Main Plaza to the new Drury Hotel. This funding is an investment in San Antonios future, concluded Smith. The legislation will be reconciled with the United States Senates transportation funding bill before heading to the Presidents desk for signature.
06.12.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), a senior member of the House Science Committee, today unveiled major solar energy legislation in Austin, Texas. The Solar Utilization Now Act of 2006, or SUN Act, provides federal grants to help states conduct solar energy projects. The answer to much of our energy needs comes up every morning, said Congressman Smith. Solar power is clean, plentiful and has zero emissions and zero waste. The SUN Act encourages state government and private industry to team up to apply for federal grants. This will enable them to buy solar energy panels at nearly half the cost.Under Smiths bill, states are required to contribute at least 10 percent of the funding. The federal government matches the grant at a maximum of 40 percent. The rest would come from utilities or private industry. Since the grants are competitive, there is an incentive for states and utilities to pledge more than the minimum amounts. Every state would be eligible to participate in the program. The programs funding starts with $50 million in the first year (2007) and ramps up to $300 million in 2011. This bill is good for our energy security, national security and environmental security, concluded Smith. Smith will formally introduce the SUN Act in the United States House of Representatives tomorrow.
06.08.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today made the following comments regarding the Administrations border policies: Along the southern border an illegal immigrant must be apprehended as many as 10 times before they are actually charged with illegal entry. This is just another form of catch and release. Although its good the President wants to end the catch and release program for non-Mexican nationals “ that is only 15 percent of all illegal immigrants apprehended. To really reduce illegal immigration, the Administration needs to enforce current laws against hiring illegal immigrants. Unfortunately, the Administration has shown little inclination to do so. Close to 500 employers were sanctioned for hiring illegal immigrants during the last two years of the Clinton Administration, compared with only 10 during the last two years of this Administration. U.S. Representative Lamar Smith is a Member and former Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Claims
06.08.2006	The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property today approved Chairman Lamar Smiths (TX-21) music licensing bill known as the Section 115 Reform Act (SIRA). This historic legislation, which passed by voice vote, will bring the multi-billion dollar music industry into the digital age.Retailers and online companies should be competing with each other, not competing with piracy, explained Chairman Smith. I can download almost anything on the Internet today, and that list should include legal copies of all music.The legislation reforms section 115 of the Copyright Act, which addresses mechanical licensing. It paves the way for legal music services to offer a full range of music to consumers. No longer will licensing issues limit services like iTunes, Yahoo, and others from offering consumers what they want, when they want it. The legislation also puts escrowed money into artists hands. Since 2001, advance money has been paid into escrow by the legal services to pay artists once a final rate was set. This legislation empowers the Copyright Royalty Board to set these final rates and then pay artists the money they have earned years ago. This bill benefits consumers by enabling mechanical licensing of all music, not just certain artists or certain categories of music. To help retailers, the legislation also covers in-store music purchases of hybrid products. Music licensing reform is necessary to pay artists what they are due and to make legal copies of all music available to every consumer, concluded Smith. This legislation is a major step forward in achieving that goal. If this isnt a platinum award-winning piece of legislation, I dont know what is.
06.07.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), former Chair and current member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, today commented on the Administrations comprehensive immigration reform plan. How can an Administration that has not enforced current immigration laws be expected to enforce new ones? asked Congressman Smith. Close to 500 employers were sanctioned for illegally hiring undocumented workers during the last two years of the Clinton Administration, compared with only 10 during the last two years of this Administration, explained Smith. To really reduce illegal immigration, the Administration needs to enforce current laws against hiring illegal immigrants. Its hard to justify legislation that would reward millions of law-breakers, attract more illegal immigrants and depress American workers wages, he said. What the Administration proposes may be good for other countries, for foreign workers and for illegal immigrants, but its not good for America, American workers or legal immigrants, concluded Smith. A study by Harvard Economist George Borjas shows that cheap immigrant labor has reduced by 7.4 percent the wages of American workers performing low-skilled jobs. And a report by the Center for Immigration Studies concludes that ˜immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a low-skilled occupation by ¦ $1,915 per year.
05.25.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) expressed disappointment over the Senate-passed immigration bill that rewards illegal immigrants with amnesty and eventual citizenship. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the United States Senate on May 25, by a vote of 62-36. Its hard to justify legislation that would reward millions of law-breakers, attract more illegal immigrants, and depress American workers wages, said Congressman Smith. The Senate bill may be good for other countries and foreign workers, but its not good for America and American workers. Although the bill contains some enforcement measures, Smith questioned, How can a government that has not enforced current immigration laws be expected to enforce new ones?
05.23.2006	Chairman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today introduced the Orphan Works Act of 2006 (H.R. 5439), which creates new guidelines for use of copyrighted material when the original owner cannot be located. The orphan works issue arises when someone who wants to use a copyrighted work cannot find the owner, no matter how diligently they search, said Chairman Smith. The owner may have moved several times, died, or in the case of businesses, changed their name or gone bankrupt. For example, a local civic association may want to include old photographs from the local library archive in their monthly newsletter, but there are no identifying marks on the photo, explained Smith. Under current law, the civic association must locate the owner to ask permission and in many cases may not be able to find the owner. Under the Orphan Works Act, they could follow guidelines posted by the Copyright Office as a show of due diligence to reduce the threat of litigation for simply doing the right thing. The Orphan Works Act is the product of over 20 hours of negotiations among various interested parties and the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, chaired by Smith. It incorporates language from a year-long study conducted by the United States Copyright Office. The bill does the following: Provides for payment of attorneys fees and costs when an infringer refuses to pay a reasonable royalty;Directs the Copyright Office to conduct an inquiry on remedies for small copyright claims;Provides explicit description of steps a potential user must undertake before using a work;Requires that paid search tools be used when reasonable;Limits the monetary relief safe harbor to uses that are for a primarily charitable, religious, scholarly, or educational purpose; Includes joint and several liability for those working with or on behalf of users;Makes clear that a lack of visible copyright ownership information on a work is not sufficient to determine that a work is an orphan work; Requires the Copyright Office to host a list of search tools and best practices guides on how to conduct a reasonably diligent search; Establishes a definition of reasonable compensation; Ensures that an orphan works system does not trump existing statutory licenses; Recognizes the state sovereign immunity issue; and Delays the effective date of the bill until June 1, 2008 to ensure copyright owners have time to develop best practices guides for searchers.This bill upholds the rights of copyright owners while providing rational limitations and remedies for cases in which the owner cannot be located, concluded Smith. I look forward to mark-up of this legislation at tomorrows Subcommittee meeting.
05.17.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today unveiled draft legislation known as the Plug-In Hybrid Electrical Vehicle Act of 2006. Smith presented his proposal at a meeting of the House Science Subcommittee on Energy, which heard testimony on the potential market for these cars from Smiths guest, Roger Duncan of Austin Energy. Plug-In hybrid cars get better gas mileage, give off fewer emissions and reduce Americas dependence on foreign oil, said Congressman Smith. For economic, environmental and strategic reasons, it makes sense to encourage automakers to go beyond their already popular hybrid vehicles to produce plug-in cars. The proposed legislation offers grants to state and local authorities to help them acquire plug-in hybrid vehicles. There is also a research and development component. This portion of the bill encourages universities and private industry to create new technologies that will make plug-in hybrids even more cost effective.The draft form discussed at todays hearing proposes $250 million in annual funding (2007-2016) for research and development of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Additionally, the legislation calls for $50 million in annual funding (2007-2016) to carry out a pilot program for deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles. Batteries in conventional hybrid cars recharge by capturing energy released during braking or through a generator attached to the combustion engine. Plug-in hybrids offer the additional option of recharging batteries by plugging the vehicle into an electrical outlet. Plug-in hybrids can be driven up to 60 miles without internal combustion engine power and with almost no emissions. The Austin City Council and Austin Energy are leading a national campaign called Plug-In Partners to demonstrate to automakers that a market exists today for plug-in hybrids. They are enlisting other cities to join their call for the production of plug-in hybrid cars. Austin is setting an example for the rest of the nation through its support for plug-in hybrid cars, concluded Smith. This legislation allows Austin and other cities across the nation to take advantage of plug-in hybrid technology.
05.04.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today voted to approve the SAFE Port Act (H.R. 4954), which is designed to enhance port security. Smith is an original sponsor of the bill and a member of the Homeland Security Committee.It is not enough to check for threats once theyve reached American soil, said Congressman Smith. We must prevent them from ever reaching our ports. The SAFE Port Act protects Americans by imposing security requirements on overseas shippers and ports where cargo starts its journey to the United States. It imposes additional security requirements on cargo while en-route to the United States and at the ports within the United States “ the last staging area before cargo makes its way into the country. The legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to employ standards for sealing all containers entering the Unites States within two years of enactment. It also requires the Department to deploy nuclear and radiological detection systems at 22 American seaports by the end of fiscal year 2007.U.S. ports are on the front lines of homeland security, and Texas has several major seaports, including Galveston, Brownsville and Houston, that offer potential routes for dangerous cargo and terrorist weapons, explained Smith. This bill will help ensure that Americans feel confident that the U.S. Government is protecting them from yet another threat.
04.25.2006	The U.S. House of Representatives today approved Congressman Lamar Smiths (TX-21) Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 (H.R. 4709), which protects the privacy of citizens and law enforcement officials by criminalizing the fraudulent sale or solicitation of confidential phone records. The bipartisan legislation was approved by a vote of 409 to 0. "Few things are more personal and potentially more revealing than our phone records, explained Smith. A careful study of these records may reveal details of our medical or financial life. It may even disclose our physical location and occupation “ a serious concern for undercover police officers and victims of stalking or domestic violence.The legislation imposes serious criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 on any person who sells, transfers, purchases or receives confidential phone records of a telephone company without the prior consent of the customer. This activity has become a money making scam in which individuals pose as a phone company customer in order to access the customers records. Some companies advertise these illegal services on the Internet, offering to obtain personal phone records for $100. We need to pass this bill to demonstrate that we take seriously the obligation to protect the confidentiality of consumer telephone records and to make clear to data thieves that their conduct will result in a felony conviction, concluded Smith. This legislation supports crime victims, prosecutors, companies and individuals who have been the targets of this fraud. The bill now heads to the Senate where similar legislation is pending.
03.20.2006	Chairman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today announced a new round of patent reform hearings by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts the Internet and Intellectual Property. The hearings to be held this spring are a follow-up to last years hearings that produced H.R. 2795, the Patent Reform Act of 2005.The legislation aims to solve patent problems confronting inventors, businesses, universities and other parties, said Chairman Smith. Additional hearings in the weeks and months ahead will help the Subcommittee develop new language for unresolved issues and revisit the major themes that gave rise to the project. I am optimistic that Subcommittee members, working with industry and government participants, can forge agreement on the remaining issues.The Subcommittees first hearing will be held Wednesday, April 5, 2006. Dates for the remaining three hearings have not yet been determined. The topics are as follows:Hearing #1: Patent Quality Enhancement in the Information-Based EconomyWednesday, April 5, 2006The Subcommittee will address the impact of questionable patents and potential issues at the Patent & Trade Mark Office. H.R. 2795 seeks to address these problems in the following ways:¢ Changes to reexamination and the creation of a post-grant opposition system to clean up bad patents on the back end; and¢ Expansion of existing provisions regarding third-party submission of prior art to assist examiners as they review applications.Hearing #2: Patent HarmonizationThe Subcommittee will look at the issue of patent harmonization. Two major components of H.R. 2795 that will be under review are:¢ Changing U.S. law from a first-to-invent system to the international standard of first-inventor-to-file system; and¢ Expanding the current requirement that most patents be published after 18 months from filing to all patents. Hearing #3: Patent Trolls: Fact or Fiction?Many high-tech and financial-service companies are concerned about the proliferation of patent trolls. The Subcommittee will seek to address the following questions:¢ What is a patent troll? How many unreasonable suits do they initiate? Are they harming the economy or just enforcing their property rights?Hearing #4: Review of the Patent Reform Studies Conducted by the National Academies and the Federal Trade CommissionThe Subcommittee will highlight studies by the National Academies and the Federal Trade Commission that reformists cite as evidence for change. Much of their work was adopted in the early draft version and current version of H.R. 2795. This includes:¢ Adoption of important harmonization features, including first-to-file and full 18-month publication of all patents;¢ Creation of a post-grant opposition system as an administrative alternative to patent litigation;¢ Revision of willful infringement and inequitable conduct claims in patent lawsuits; and ¢ Allowance of pre-grant submission of prior art by third parties to ensure that a proposed invention is genuinely novel.
03.08.2006	The U.S. House of Representatives today approved the, Childrens Safety and Violent Crimes Reduction Act of 2006, (H.R. 4472) cosponsored by Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21). The legislation aims to protect children from sexual predators by strengthening criminal penalties and notification laws. This legislation empowers parents and educators to better protect their children, said Congressman Smith. When parents and communities are armed with information, they can reduce the likelihood that their children will fall victim to sex offenders. Today more than 500,000 convicted sex offenders live in the United States, and approximately 150,000 are missing. Once released, sex offenders are four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime. The bill includes a number of provisions designed to protect children, including:Improving the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Program to ensure that sex offenders register and keep current, where they reside, work and attend school; Improving verification systems for sex offender information by requiring quarterly-verification, sex offender in-person verification, and regular notarized verification mailings; Requiring public access to state websites that list sex offenders; Creating the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website to search for sex offender information in each community; Expanding the definition of sex offenders to include juvenile sex offenders; Requiring states to notify each other when a sex offender moves from one state to another; Expanding sex offenses covered by registration and notification requirements to include military, tribal and foreign sex crimes, and increases duration of registration requirements to protect the public;Expanding community notification requirements to include active efforts to inform law enforcement agencies, schools, public housing, social service agencies and volunteer organizations in area where sex offender resides, works or attends school; and Creating a new maximum penalty of 20 years incarceration for a sex offender who fails to comply with registration requirements, and increasing criminal penalties against child sexual predators.The legislation passed by voice vote and now heads to the U.S. Senate for consideration.
03.02.2006	The House Judiciary Committee today approved IP Subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smiths (TX-21) Law Enforcement and Phone Privacy Protection Act of 2006 (H.R. 4709), designed to protect the privacy of citizens and law enforcement officials by criminalizing the fraudulent sale or solicitation of confidential cell phone records. The bipartisan legislation was approved by voice vote. "Few things are more personal and potentially more revealing than our phone records, explained Smith. The records of whom we choose to call and how long we speak with them can reveal much about our business and personal lives. A careful study of these records may reveal details of our medical or financial life. It may even disclose our physical location. This is a serious concern for undercover police officers and victims of stalking or domestic violence.New federal criminal penalties are needed to deter and punish these dishonest individuals and businesses “ and to put them out of business permanently. The bipartisan bill provides new, explicit and strengthened protections for the privacy of confidential telephone records, including calling logs. It establishes specific criminal penalties for the fraudulent acquisition or disclosure of these records without consumer consent.H.R. 4709 imposes serious criminal penalties “ up to 20 years in prison “ for anyone who knowingly and intentionally obtains or attempts to obtain the confidential phone records of a telephone company using a fraudulent scheme or device. The bill further imposes up to five years imprisonment on anyone who: 1) either sells or transfers or attempts to sell or transfer such records without authorization; or 2) purchases such records knowing they were obtained without authorization. The unauthorized trade in this information not only assaults individual privacy, but it the wrong hands can lead to violence and in the most extreme instances, even death, concluded Smith. We must act to deter these acts by providing that anyone who seeks to wrongfully acquire or disclose these records faces serious criminal consequences.
03.01.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21), Co-Chairman of the Congressional High-Tech Working Group, stood with House leaders today to unveil the Innovation & Competitiveness Act, a package of bills designed to spur economic growth and keep America competitive in todays global economy. America has led the world economically over the last century, explained Congressman Smith. But we cant rest on our laurels. To compete today, we need to encourage innovation, foster creativity and promote a talented workforce. To do these things, we must remove burdensome regulation and litigation. We must make research and education a priority. And finally, we must lower taxes and protect intellectual property rights. The High-Tech Working Groups Innovation & Competitiveness Act contains the following provisions and objectives: 1. Frivolous lawsuit reduction measures that will reduce the burden of meritless lawsuits on Americas small business owners so they can focus resources on growing their business and creating new jobs.2. An expansion of the Research and Development Tax Credit to ensure businesses have the resources they need to stay competitive in a changing global marketplace. 3. Loan forgiveness for math and science teachers as well as funding for new science Masters Degree programs to enhance Americas talent pool. 4. Business activity tax provisions that will limit certain state taxes to promote online commerce. 5. Health Internet technology provisions that promote the use of technology to improve the efficiency and quality of care in our health care system. In addition to these measures, we must also look at ways to protect intellectual property, concluded Smith who serves as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property. Intellectual property industries account for 40 percent of our economic growth and about half of our gross domestic product. By protecting American ideas we can ensure a high quality of life for our citizens for the next century and beyond.
02.24.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) today offered the following statement on the Administrations decision to once again extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for persons from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua: Yesterdays extension of TPS is evidence that the Administration is not serious about ensuring ˜temporary immigrants return to their home countries after a defined period. These countries were designated for TPS in 1999 and 2001 after a hurricane and an earthquake made them temporarily unsafe to live. These natural disasters happened over seven and five years ago. Some of these individuals have been in the United States for up to seven years because their ˜temporary status has been repeatedly extended. The federal government just cant say ˜no when there are requests to remain in the country. Calling this status ˜temporary makes a mockery of Americas immigration policies. Unfortunately, the word temporary is used all too often in Americas immigration debate, but never really means anything but ˜permanent. I am concerned that the same thing will ring true for the Administrations temporary worker program.
02.16.2006	Congressmen Lamar Smith (TX-21), Lloyd Doggett (TX-25) and Michael McCaul (TX-10) today introduced House Resolution 689, recognizing the 10th Anniversary of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. On February 21, 1996, the Austin-based Texas Council on Family Violence launched the Hotline. Since that time, the group has answered over 1.5 million calls and saved countless lives. The three Austin-area Congressmen offered the following statements upon introduction of the resolution: Congressman Lamar Smith: The National Domestic Violence Hotline is a life-line for victims of domestic violence and their families. Over the last decade, the Hotline has provided victims with crisis counseling, information on legal advocacy, shelters and health care facilities. For the last 10 years, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has been helping America hold the family together. We are glad to have this beacon of hope in our community. Congressman Lloyd Doggett: "When a victim has the courage to reach for help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline answers the call, guides them to a safe place, and connects them to the resources they need. I am a long-time and strong supporter of their work."Congressman Michael McCaul: The National Domestic Violence Hotline ranks as one of the most important services we can help offer families at times when those families face crisis. I am proud that Austin is home to these voices and continues to offer local support to this important organization. I am confident our government and country will continue supporting this important need. The National Domestic Violence Hotline was created by Congress in 1994, as part of the Violence Against Women Act. Congress continues its commitment to Americas families by continuously strengthening and renewing this important legislation. Todays resolution is another example of Congress commitment to addressing domestic violence.
02.14.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) will join President Bush and other members of the Texas Congressional Delegation today as they welcome college footballs national Champions, the University of Texas (UT) Longhorns to the White House. The UT football team also will be recognized in the House of Representatives later today when Congressman Smith delivers a floor speech congratulating the team on their undefeated season. The Longhorns have a special place deep in the heart of all Texans, said Congressman Smith. Their undefeated season was capped-off by one of the most heroic Rose Bowl efforts in football history. Smith added, Through hard work and determination the Longhorns beat the odds and became an example for all of us. The UT campus is part of the 21st Congressional District that Smith represents. He plans to address the United States House of Representatives in recognition of the teams unbeaten season and historic Rose Bowl win. This will be the third speech Smith has given this Congress congratulating UT on its athletic accomplishments. In June, the Longhorns baseball team won their sixth national championship title. And last January, UT won the Rose Bowl over the University of Michigan. The Longhorns are keeping me busy in Washington, Smith joked. The University has given our community and our state much to be proud of. Under Coach Mack Brown, and led by quarterback Vince Young, the Longhorns won 20 straight games.Credit for this outstanding season is due to the entire team, the coaching staff and the athletic department at the University of Texas, said Smith. Now everyone in America understands the meaning of "Hook ˜em Horns!"
02.03.2006	Today, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), Rep. John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) announced that they will introduce the Law Enforcement and Phone Privacy Protection Act of 2006. Smith is the Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. Rep. Conyers is the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Goodlatte is the Chairman of the House Republican High-Tech Working Group. Rep. Scott is the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. The bipartisan bill will protect the privacy of citizens and law enforcement officials by criminalizing the fraudulent sale or solicitation of confidential cell phone records. In anticipation of the bills introduction early next week, Reps. Smith, Conyers, Goodlatte and Scott offered the following statement: "There are few things more personal than our phone call records. Dishonest individuals and businesses are posing as cell phone customers to access the personal call records of other individuals. These people have flourished in a gray area of the law. But that is about to stop."These practices assault our individual privacy, and may even contribute to stalking or other crimes of violence. In the wrong hands, this information can be used to target police officers, their families, and confidential informants. According to press reports, the FBI and the Chicago Police Department have begun to investigate this problem and recently took steps to warn their personnel, in particular undercover officers, to protect themselves from the release of sensitive personal information that might endanger them. "We must ensure that the best interests of consumers and law enforcement officials are taken into account and fully protected from the unauthorized release of private call information. Congress must take immediate action to deter these acts by providing that anyone who seeks to wrongfully acquire or disclose these records is confronted with serious consequences under the criminal laws of the United States. The House Judiciary Committee is the appropriate forum for considering these changes to the criminal law. We are committed to working with all interested parties to enact this legislation, which is urgently needed to preserve consumers' privacy rights and to protect the personal safety of law enforcement personnel."
01.31.2006	Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) today welcomed the release of the Report on Orphan Works by the U.S. Copyright Office, which examines the difficulties faced when potential users of a copyrighted work cannot find the copyright owner to seek permission. The current process for dealing with orphan works inhibits the creation of new uses of these works, said Congressman Smith. This report will shed light on the problem and potential answers. The report, which was requested by Chairman Smith and other members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees last year, identifies potential approaches to addressing the problem, like requiring potential users to first undertake a reasonable search for the owner. If this search does not succeed, the user would be allowed to use the work subject to certain conditions. If the copyright owner does reappear, the proposed language limits injunctive remedies.Orphan works occur for a variety of reasons. A corporate copyright owner may have changed ownership numerous times or gone out of business decades ago. A photo of a historical location may contain no identifying marks of who the copyright owner is (typically the photographer). A recording of a musical work may contain no identification of the artist in the soundtrack and the physical label may have faded or fallen off. Artists may have died leaving no will or one that can be easily found to identify the copyright owners descendant who now owns the copyright. I look forward to studying the report to see if there is a way to bring clarity to the orphan works copyright issue, concluded Smith.
01.31.2006	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) issued the following statement in response to President Bushs comments on a foreign worker program in tonights State of the Union Address:The President offered a clear vision for strengthening America at home and abroad. I am encouraged to hear the President call for greater security along the border and greater enforcement of existing immigration laws.While I agree with most of the Presidents ideas, I have serious concerns about foreign worker programs and their effect on American workers. Foreign worker programs hurt American workers. Studies show that competition from cheap foreign labor depresses wages and takes jobs away from American citizens and legal immigrants alike. A study by Harvard Economist George Borjas shows that cheap immigrant labor has reduced the wages of American workers performing low-skilled jobs by 7.4 percent. And a report by the Center for Immigration Studies concludes that ˜immigration may reduce the wages of the average native [worker] in a low-skilled occupation by . . . $1,915 per year. A foreign worker program is also unenforceable. It is unrealistic to expect that people who have been in this country for up to nine years, who bring their families and who have put down roots will ever return home.
01.05.2006	The University of Texas Congressman lauded college footballs national champions today for their heroic victory and undefeated season. The Horns fourth finish atop college footballs ranks will be recognized by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) on the floor of the House of Representatives when the full Congress reconvenes. Despite trailing much of the game, the Horns would not give up, Congressman Smith said. The tenacity and dedication they displayed “ and two TDs in the final seven minutes “ are an example for us all. The UT campus is part of the 21st Congressional District that Smith represents. He plans to address the House of Representatives in recognition of the accomplishments of the Longhorn football team. This will be Smiths third speech this Congress congratulating UT on its sports championships. In June, the Longhorns baseball team won their sixth national championship title. And last January, UT won the Rose Bowl over the University of Michigan. The Longhorns are keeping me busy in Washington, Smith joked. The University has given our community and our state so much to be proud of. Under Coach Mack Brown and led by quarterback Vince Young, the Longhorns have won 20 straight games.Credit for this outstanding victory, Smith said Is due to the entire team, coaching staff and the athletic department at the University of Texas. After this season, Smith said, the whole nation now understands the power of ˜Hook ˜em!
12.16.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) hailed todays passage of the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. Smith is one of four original cosponsors of the bill. This is the most significant border security bill in nearly a decade, said Congressman Smith. This legislation represents a crucial step forward in securing our borders and protecting the lives and property of Americans. The Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 (H.R. 4437) achieves four essential goals:¢ It combats illegal immigrant smuggling;¢ It makes it easier to apprehend, convict and deport potential terrorists; ¢ It allows employers to determine whether a job applicant is in the United States legally; and ¢ It holds individuals accountable for breaking immigration laws. Immigration is an emotional, sensitive and complex subject, explained Smith. But Americans “ citizens and legal immigrants alike “ have every right to secure borders and a safe homeland. It is time we turned that right into reality.
12.14.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) stood beside President George Bush today at the White House as the President signed an Executive Order that will make the Federal government more responsive to public inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Administrations order embodies the principles of the OPEN Government Act of 2005 introduced by Congressman Smith and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX). The Administrations action is a good first step toward reforming the FOIA process to reduce backlogs, expedite FOIA request processing and hold government agencies accountable for answering inquiries, said Congressman Smith. The Freedom of Information Act enables citizens to check on the federal branch, and we must ensure that the government is complying. Smith added, Under the law, any concerned citizen or media representative should be able to submit a request for information and get a timely response. If a federal agency finds that it cannot disclose certain documents, then it must state its reasons for not doing so. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining government information is overly burdensome and federal agencies have become less than responsive to public requests for information. Agencies have misplaced or lost information requests. In many cases citizens have waited months and sometimes years for requests to be answered. Todays Executive Order provides strong incentives for federal agencies to comply with FOIA. The order requires the creation of a chief FOIA officer within each agency to review the agencies current FOIA process. The officer will develop and implement a plan for better processing and backlog elimination, said Smith. Taxpayers have a right to know what the government is doing, concluded Smith. Access to such information strengthens the peoples trust in government, which is essential to a democracy.
12.08.2005	Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) today welcomed the release of a study by the General Accountability Office (GAO) on fraudulent identification information among domain name owners. The study was requested by the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property earlier this year. With the holiday shopping season well underway, consumers need assurance that their online purchases are not actually online scams, explained Chairman Smith. One way for online consumers to identify who they are really buying from is to look up their vendors WHOIS registration record. Vendors unwilling to identify themselves publicly are more than likely fraudulent. Although this public record can be a helpful tool to avoid fraud, little is done to see if the identifying information provided by Internet merchants is legitimate. Until now, firm statistics have never been available on the prevalence of this problem.The GAOs new statistics show that slightly more than five percent of domain names have been registered with patently false information. The study also finds that the system used by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to weed out such fraudulent identifications simply is not working. Over two-thirds of the fraudulent domain names were uncorrected even after a GAO auditor pointed out the false information to ICANN. Today, we have a better sense of the problems consumers face when they shop online, concluded Smith. I look forward to working further on this issue next year to protect American consumers from online fraud.

12.08.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) hosted a congressional briefing on plug-in hybrid vehicles today with members of the House Science Subcommittee on Energy. The group heard from Roger Duncan, Deputy General Manager of Austin Energy. His initiative seeks to demonstrate to automakers that a market exists for plug-in hybrids. If this initiative is copied by other cities, people will save money on fuel, conserve energy and reduce harmful emissions, explained Congressman Smith.Conventional hybrids batteries are recharged by capturing the energy released during braking or through a generator attached to the combustion engine. Plug-in hybrids offer the additional option of recharging batteries by plugging the vehicle into an appropriate outlet. Recharged plug-in hybrids can be driven 20-60 miles without internal combustion engine power (all-electric, zero-emission). This means less pollution and cleaner air. The plug-in hybrid vehicle has the potential to reduce oil dependence on foreign oil imports, said Smith. Forty percent of the oil consumed in the U.S. is used to fuel cars and trucks, at a cost to consumers in 2004 of $250 billion. U.S. dependence on foreign oil is projected to rise to more than 60 percent by 2020, Smith pointed out. Under the direction of the Austin City Council, the City of Austin and Austin Energy are leading a national campaign to demonstrate to automakers that a market exists today for plug-in hybrids. They are trying to enlist other cities to do the same. The so-called 50-City Plan seeks support from utilities to develop $50-$100 million in incentives from utilities for plug-in hybrid procurement and fleet purchase commitments by government, private businesses and consumers. Smith commented, Austin is setting an example for the rest America with this unique initiative.
12.08.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX-21) today hailed the passage of the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005, which was approved by the House Judiciary Committee. This legislation, if it becomes law, would be a huge step forward in securing our borders and protecting the lives and property of Americans, said Congressman Smith. Congressman Smith is an original co-sponsor of the legislation (H.R. 4437), which: ¢ combats illegal immigrant smuggling and discourages the entry and presence in our country of foreigners who have committed crimes;¢ makes it easier to apprehend, convict, and deport potential terrorists; ¢ allows employers to check whether a job applicant is legally in the United States; and ¢ results in more illegal immigrants being deported more quickly. Immigration is an emotional, sensitive and complex subject, explained Congressman Smith. But Americans “ citizens and legal immigrants alike “ have every right to secure borders and a safe homeland.
11.18.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) announced today that he has secured $5.6 million for area transportation projects and infrastructure improvements. These funds all will be used to enhance Austins economic vitality, said Congressman Smith. The projects are:*$3 million for the demolition and rehabilitation of a partially-destroyed structure in downtown Austin. The funds will prepare the site for construction of a new federal courthouse set to begin in 2007. *$2 million toward the creation of a commuter and inter-city passenger rail service that will improve freight and personal movement in the heavily congested I-35 Corridor. The funds will support additional alternatives analysis, environmental planning and design work needed to initiate the project. *$500,000 to complete a new maintenance and housing facility for the vehicles serving Capital Metros Northern routes and the University of Texas shuttle services. Capital Metros Special Transit Services operations and vehicles will also be located at this facility. *$100,000 for the construction and rehabilitation of space at the International Center of Austin for the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT). This prestigious information technology event is attended by world leaders and will bring international attention and resources to the Austin area. The funds were included in the FY 2006 House Transportation, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, which passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 392 to 31.
11.18.2005	Today several area Congressmen announced that they have obtained $3 million for the demolition and rehabilitation of a partially destroyed structure in downtown Austin. The funds will prepare the site for construction of a new federal courthouse set to begin in 2007. Representatives Lamar Smith (TX-21), Lloyd Doggett (TX-25) and Michael McCaul (TX-10) worked to have the funds included in the FY 2006 House Transportation, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act. The Texas Representatives made the following statements after passage of the bill: Congressman Lamar Smith: Austin is known for its unique architecture. This structure has been a blemish on the face of our city. By removing it, we will make room for a new, critically needed courthouse. Congressman Lloyd Doggett: "This money is a win-win for the city and the federal government. The money will go to good use “ turning an unhappy remnant into a treasure in the heart of downtown."Congressman Michael McCaul: This funding will speed up the efforts already in progress of turning an eyesore into a stunning addition to Austins skyline. The new federal courthouse will serve as an added foundation to the downtown areas growing economy.The funds were included in the FY 2006 House Transportation, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, which passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 392 to 31.
11.10.2005	Today, five members of the Texas Congressional Delegation announced that they have obtained $600,000 for the Lower Colorado River Basin Flood Study. Congressmen Lamar Smith (TX-21), Ron Paul (TX-14), RubÃ©n Hinojosa (TX-15), Michael McCaul (TX-10), and Mike Conaway (TX-11) worked to include these funds in the FY 2006 House Energy and Water Appropriations Act. This important project evaluates flood control alternatives in the 11 counties along the Colorado River in Texas and assesses the potential damage of a 500-year flood. The Texas Representatives made the following statements after passage of the bill: Congressman Lamar Smith: The end goal is to reduce property damage and loss of life as a result of flooding. The completed study will accomplish this goal by helping us identify effective flood prevention measures. Congressman Ron Paul: "I am pleased to give on-going support to Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) for this important project and glad that we have been able to get it funded this year." Congressman RubÃ©n Hinojosa: "We all know the devastation that severe flooding can cause. Through new technologies, scientific research and development, study and project implementation, such as the Lower Colorado River Corps Study, we can take the necessary preventative measures to secure our communities from the consequences of natural disasters." Congressman Michael McCaul: During the 1990s alone, there were 39 flood events in the Lower Colorado River Basin, four of which resulted in Presidential disaster declarations. These floods caused $44 million in damage and 11 flood-related deaths. This vital project means we can start investigating alternative flood controls to avoid these kinds of devastating and deadly floods in the future. The LCRA provides an invaluable service to the communities it works with by helping them plan for and implement flood control management projects, this money will help in those efforts."Congressman Mike Conaway: The LCRA serves our communities in so many valuable ways, and I am pleased that we were able to secure funding for their efforts. Evaluating possible flood control alternatives and making potential damage assessments are responsibilities that must be seriously addressed. With this funding the LCRA will assist in making Texas families safer from disastrous flooding.The FY 2006 House Energy and Water Appropriations Act passed the House Wednesday by a vote of 399 to 17.
11.09.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) announced today that he has obtained $2.7 million for Austin-area projects. The funds will be used to provide local law enforcement and the University of Texas laboratories with new technology for training. Other funds appropriated will go toward completion of a Lower Colorado River Basin Flood Study Project. These funds will help improve the quality of life for those that live, work and learn in Austin, said Congressman Smith. The projects are:* $2 million for completion of the Petawatt Laser Project at the University of Texas at Austin. The high-power laser would be the largest of its kind in the world, and would be used by scientists in high-energy density research fields to develop expertise and train future educators. Congressman Smith has obtained a total of $6 million in funding for the University of Texas during this Congress. * $100,000 for the City of Austin Police Department. These funds will provide the department with the latest in law enforcement training technology. This would include the purchase of a wireless automated fingerprint system, a driving simulator, and a firearms training system simulator. * $600,000 for the Lower Colorado River Basin Flood Study. This important project evaluates flood control alternatives in the 11 counties along the Colorado River in Texas and assesses the potential damage of a 500-year flood. The funds were included in two separate appropriations bills “ the House Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Bill and the House Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. Both bills passed the House by a vote of 397 to 19 and 399 to 17 respectively.
11.09.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (TX-21) announced today that he has obtained $650,000 for San Antonio community improvement projects. These funds will be used to develop educational programs for at-risk youth, and prevent flooding in the area. This funding is critical for providing children and their families the tools to develop important academic and social skills that can lead to greater success in life, said Congressman Smith. It will also help reduce and eliminate flooding in San Antonio neighborhoods. The projects are:*$150,000 for Boysville Inc. Boysville is a nationally recognized care center offering foster care, emergency shelter, and transitional living homeless or at-risk youth. The funding will be used for a juvenile delinquency prevention initiative, which includes counseling, social skills training, and parent education. * $500,000 for the Guadalupe/San Antonio River Basin Interim Feasibility Study. This project is a comprehensive watershed study that addresses frequent flooding and declining water quality. Communities involved in this project include Alamo Heights and areas along Salado Creek. The funds were included in two separate appropriations bills “ the House Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Bill and the House Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. Both bills passed the House by a vote of 397 to 19 and 399 to 17, respectively.
10.27.2005	The House of Representatives passed the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (H.R. 420) today, legislation introduced by U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith to reduce the filing of frivolous lawsuits. The measure passed by a vote of 228 to 184 and now heads to the Senate for consideration."Frivolous lawsuits bankrupt individuals, ruin reputations, drive up insurance premiums, increase health care costs, and put a drag on the economy. Today almost any party can bring any suit in almost any jurisdiction. Thats because plaintiffs and their attorneys have nothing to lose. All they want is for the defendant to settle. This is legalized extortion. It is lawsuit lottery. Some lawyers file lawsuits for reasons that can only be described as absurd. They sue a theme park because its haunted houses are too scary. They sue the Weather Channel for an inaccurate forecast. And they sue McDonalds claiming a hot pickle dropped from a hamburger caused a burn and mental injury.Defendants, on the other hand, can unfairly lose their careers, their businesses and their reputations. This is not justice. But there is a remedy: the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, Smith said while speaking in support of the bill on the House floor.LARA accomplishes two goals: ¢ Requires plaintiffs to pay the attorneys fees of defendants when the judge determines that a frivolous lawsuit was filed, and; ¢ Reduces court-friendly shopping by requiring personal injury cases to be filed either where the plaintiff lives or was injured, or where the defendant's principal place of business is located. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act is sensible reform that will help restore confidence to Americas justice system, Smith concluded.
10.18.2005	U.S. Representative Lamar Smith today refuted the findings of a recent poll that attempts to define the views of Republicans toward guest worker programs. The poll, which was conducted by the Tarrance Group and released by the Manhattan Institute, claims that a majority of Republicans support guest worker programs, a finding that runs contrary to the findings of other national polls on the topic, said Rep. Smith."The outcome of a poll is all in how you phrase the questions. In the case of the Manhattan Institute, their poll contains slanted questions designed to get the answers they want. They achieved the desired results of the Institute − to find support for guest worker programs. For example, a question about a foreign worker program omits any mention that the workers are in the country illegally. If the question were factual, the response would have been significantly different.A CBS poll taken earlier this year asked respondents whether immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally should be allowed to apply for work permits and stay in the United States. More than two thirds of Republicans responded that they should not be allowed and 63% of all the respondents, which included Democrats and Independents, were opposed to guest worker programs. "The Manhattan Institute supports a guest worker program, so they got the results they wanted. No one should believe the poll accurately reflects public sentiment, Smith concluded.
10.07.2005	Today more than 80 House Members let the Bush Administration know of their opposition to guestworker programs until current immigration laws are better enforced. Their views were made known through a letter authored by Congressmen John Hostettler (R−IN), Tom Tancredo (R−CO), and Lamar Smith (R−TX).In the letter, the large coalition of House Members state that while guestworker and amnesty provisions have a history of being implemented, enforcement provisions have been consistently ignored and underfunded by the government. The Members believe that this has resulted in large increases in illegal immigration, and has decreased faith in the governments ability to secure the nations borders. The American people need to see that the current laws against illegal immigration are being enforced before any guestworker program can be considered, the Members state in the letter. The letter cites several examples of the governments reluctance to enforce immigration laws, including the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act in which amnesties for farm workers and other illegal aliens were carried out, but employer sanctions and other enforcement provisions were not. Rep. Smiths 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act is also provided as an example of the federal governments unwillingness to enforce laws against illegal immigration. The Act mandated the implementation of a national exit-entry tracking system for all aliens. However, nine years later, the exit-entry system is still not near completion. Today an estimated 12 to 20 million illegal aliens are in the United States. They know that if they successfully enter the country and find a job, they will likely be able to stay for the rest of their lives because the government has shown little interest in enforcing its own laws. Employers also know that once they hire an illegal alien, it is unlikely that they will ever be investigated or prosecuted for doing so. Enforcement of the laws against illegal immigration and employing illegal aliens is necessary, the Members conclude in the letter. Rep. Hostettler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration added, The enforcement of our current immigration laws--especially worksite compliance--is essential to restoring the confidence of the American people in the rule of law. Given that the Basic Pilot Program is available to every employer in the United States, the Administration should place the elimination of the 'jobs magnet' at the top of the priority list."Rep. Tancredo, the chairman of the House Immigration Reform Caucus added, The days of bait-and-switch are over. This letter”signed by a large portion of the Republican conference”shows that the political momentum has changed in our favor. No guestworker plan will pass Congress without first securing the borders and enforcing current laws.Rep. Smith, a former chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, concluded, We have lost control of our borders and endangered the lives of Americans by not enforcing immigration laws. For example, the current 'catch and release' policy enables 85 percent of illegal immigrants who are apprehended to go free. It is unlawful to hire illegal immigrants but not a single employer was fined for doing so last year. "Only a fraction of the vehicles crossing our borders are checked for illegal immigrants or illegal cargo. We have no system at our land borders to determine whether people whose short−term visas have expired have left the country. Finally, many illegal immigrants who have been convicted of aggravated felonies are released rather than deported.The letter was signed by the following 82 House Members: Hostettler (IN), Smith (TX), Tancredo (CO), Hayworth (AZ), Paul (TX), King (IA), Sullivan (OK), Rohrabacher (CA), Norwood (GA), Goode (VA), Marchant (TX), Culberson (TX), Weldon (FL), Coble (NC), Brown-Waite (FL), Duncan (TN), Sessions (TX), Bilirakis (FL), Jones (NC), Garrett (NJ), Gutknecht (MN), Barrett (SC), McCotter (MI), Deal (GA), Royce (CA), Sodrel (IN), Bradley (NH), Wamp (TN), Blackburn (TN), Ney (OH), Jenkins (TN), McKeon (CA), Poe (TX), Jo Ann Davis (VA), Burton (IN), Hunter (CA), Capito (WV), Hefley (CO), Cunningham (CA), Carter (TX), Istook (OK), Burgess (TX), Cubin (WY), Gary Miller (CA), Platts (PA), Stearns (FL), McHenry (NC), Akin (MO), Johnson (TX), Rogers (MI), Issa (CA), McCaul (TX), Myrick (NC), Weldon (PA), Hayes (NC) , Bishop (UT), Westmoreland (GA), Aderholt (AL), Bachus (AL), Manzullo (IL), Foxx (NC), Bartlett (MD), Boozman (AR), Ryun (KN), Gingrey (GA), Miller (FL), Brady (TX), Gordon (TN), Everett (AL), Calvert (CA), Pickering (MS), Buyer (IN), Drake (VA), Graves (MO), Ramstad (MN), Pearce (NM), Kelly (NY), Lewis (KY), Shuster (PA), Forbes (VA), Hoekstra (MI), Neugebauer (TX).
09.27.2005	U.S. Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas) commended the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today for the first conviction under the Family and Entertainment Copyright Act. The law, authored by Smith, made it a felony for persons to use handheld technology, like camcorders, to record a movie in a theater and then distribute the pirated version. The conviction came as a result of the Justice Departments Operation Copycat, an ongoing campaign to crack down on the illegal copying and distribution of movies. Under the operation, Curtis Salisbury, a resident of St. Charles, Missouri, was indicted and pled guilty to using a camcorder in movie theaters to copy recent theatrical releases and then upload the copies to a computer network for distribution.Said Smith, This conviction is a victory for America's creators. Piracy and intellectual property theft cost American businesses billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs each year. This theft is a direct threat to those whose livelihoods depend on their creations. Copyright thieves are now on notice that stealing intellectual property will not be tolerated.Smith is the chairman of House Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.
09.22.2005	Today, the Subcommittee will receive an update on the progress that has, and has not, been made in combating P2P piracy on university campuses. First, let me note that there have already been several significant actions that have occurred off university campuses. Only a few months ago, the Supreme Court clearly delineated the liability of P2P software providers. Until this decision was released, certain P2P providers had consistently disclaimed any liability for the piracy that their software enabled. Now, many of these services are in talks to become distributors of legal sources of content.However, universities are where P2P piracy flourishes. I am pleased to see progress in combating such piracy. Copyright issues are no longer an afterthought in many universities. During the last academic year, several universities offered legal services to lure students away from illegal downloading and file-sharing.Other institutions offered increased education programs or better enforcement of their copyright policies. Coming from high school environments where copyright issues are either deliberately ignored or simply unknown to parents and teachers, college students often use the very high speed Internet connections as a source of free content. While college students often test boundaries, campuses should not be places where illegal activity becomes a routine of a students life that will only continue after graduation.Universities have recognized that part of their educational mission is not only centered on turning out architects, lawyers, nurses, musicians, and economists. Their mission also includes creating well-rounded individuals with respect for others and the laws of our country. Several years ago, it was obvious that respect for the nations copyright laws was not a high priority of many university students or their universities. To address this issue, a joint university “ content owners group was created in 2003. Co-chaired by Graham Spanier of Penn State and Cary Sherman of RIAA, this working group has met regularly to bring together groups that rarely interacted before. This working group has provided the Subcommittee an update of its activities in its written submission.Today, the Subcommittee will hear from two universities, one from my district. Both universities have undertaken several efforts related to student education, ranging from copyright information provided on orientation day to automated systems that warn students of conduct not permitted under university guidelines. We will also hear from one provider of legal content to universities and the experiences they have had. Finally, we have a representative of a content trade association who can speak to the increasing use of high speed university networks to transfer large video files.This is a good time to understand why some universities have clearly stepped up to the plate of educating their students, while others have not. The Subcommittee will continue to hold hearings on P2P piracy to monitor progress and to update Congress on what still needs to be done.
09.01.2005	Congressmen Lamar Smith (R−Texas) and Steve Chabot (R−OH), co-chairmen of the House of Representatives Judicial Accountability Working Group, were joined by 83 House Republican leaders and members today in calling for a swift Senate confirmation of Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge John Roberts.In a letter sent to Senators Arlen Specter (R−PA) and Patrick Leahy (D−VT), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the members affirmed their unified support for Judge Roberts and encouraged their Senate colleagues to confirm his appointment expeditiously. The American people deserve to witness a dignified and professional process that upholds the vision of our founding fathers. Judge Roberts has demonstrated his commitment to this country, the Constitution, and the laws of the United States, the Members said in the letter. When he was considered for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Judge Roberts nomination was endorsed by well-respected Republicans and Democrats alike. He was described as having one of the best legal minds of his generation, the Members added. As the co-chairmen of the Houses judicial watchdog group, Smith and Chabot said that Roberts record demonstrates that he recognizes the correct role of the judicial branch in a democratic system of government. They stated that, Judges have a duty to interpret our laws and our Constitution rather than to substitute their personal beliefs for the law. We believe Judge Roberts will interpret the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench. The Senate begins deliberations on Judge Roberts on September 6th. The Members concluded that the nation would be well served if he is confirmed before the Supreme Court begins its session in October. Smith is the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property. Chabot chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution.

08.09.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) congratulated NASA and the crew of the space shuttle Discovery today on their trip to the International Space Station and test of repair techniques for future shuttle missions. Smith is a senior member of the House Science Committees Subcommittee on Space.Congratulations to NASA and the crew of Discovery on a successful mission. The eyes and the hopes of this nation have been on them for the past fourteen days as the astronauts successfully completed their objectives and conducted the first spacewalk repair of an orbiter. Their efforts have put us back in the manned space flight business, Smith said."Fortunately, further complications with the external fuel tanks foam insulation were quickly identified by new safety measures on this test flight. I have every confidence that the agency will find the solution to this problem and keep the shuttle program on track, Smith concluded.
08.04.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) commended the Department of Justice today for its efforts through Operation Copycat to crack down on the illegal copying and distribution of movies. The operation produced the first indictment under a new law known as the Family and Entertainment Copyright Act, which was authored by Smith. Smith said, Todays indictment is a victory for America's creators. Piracy and intellectual property theft cost American businesses billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs each year. This theft is a direct threat to those whose livelihoods depend on their creations. Copyright thieves are now on notice that stealing intellectual property will not be tolerated. The Family and Entertainment Copyright Act made it illegal to use handheld technology to record and distribute movies by making it a felony to record a movie in a theater. ###
07.29.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $12.8 million for transportation projects in the 21st Congressional District. The funds are part of the Transportation Equity Act, which received final House of Representatives approval Friday.These funds will address traffic congestion, improve our highways, and create new jobs. In addition, this legislation will reduce traffic related injuries and fatalities by funding highway safety improvement and driver safety awareness programs, said Smith.The funds secured by Smith include:*$2.4 million for Cesar Chavez: This project converts Cesar Chavez, a major route to downtown Austin, to two-way traffic for its entire 2.25 miles between MO-PAC and I-35. *$1.6 million for State Highway 71: This funding applies to the four-lane expansion project from the Oak Hill area westward to its intersection with US 281.*$800,000 for Austin bicycle routes: This funding is for a Bicycle and Pedestrian program throughout the City. *$2.4 million for US 290: This project upgrades US 290 from east of Williamson Creek to west of FM 1826.*$4.86 million for State Highway 130: This funding helps complete the southern 40-mile portion of SH 130 from Interstate 10 at Seguin to I−35 near Buda.*$800,000 for the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Communication Link “ This project will establish a center-to-center communication link between Transportation Management Centers in San Antonio and other Texas cities. It will help facilitate traffic management advisories in the city, which can be essential during times of natural disasters or emergency evacuations. Smith was also able to obtain approval for the future construction of a $350 million commuter rail project in the bill. Once completed, commuter trains will run on existing rail lines along the I-35 corridor. The effect of this is that it puts the commuter rail project in line for future funding.
07.28.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) cosponsored and managed a bill on the floor of the House of Representatives today that improves Americans access to medical care and lowers health care costs around the nation. H.R. 5, the Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-Cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act passed by a margin of 230 to 194. The legislation reduces the excessive burden the liability system places on health care providers. As a result, patient access to health care services and the quality of medical care will be improved. Said Smith, I strongly support the HEALTH Act. The median medical liability award has more than doubled from 1996 to 2003, to $1.2 million. Insurers have been forced either to leave the medical malpractice market entirely or increase their rates to unaffordable levels. Doctors and other health care providers are being forced to abandon patients and practices, particularly in high-risk specialties such as emergency medicine, brain surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. Women are particularly hard hit, as are low-income neighborhoods and rural areas, added Smith. According to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services: ˜Unless a state has adopted limitations on non-economic damages ... [t]he cost of these awards for non-economic damages is paid by all other Americans through higher health care costs, higher health insurance premiums, higher taxes, reduced access to quality care, and threats to quality of care, Smith noted. The HEALTH Act bill is modeled on Californias Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act, which has resulted in Californias medical professional liability premiums increasing only one-third as much as they have in other states. It includes a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages; limits on the contingency fees lawyers can charge; a fair share rule, by which damages are allocated in direct proportion to fault; reasonable guidelines “ but not caps “ on the award of punitive damages; and a safe harbor from punitive damages for products that meet FDA safety requirements. The HEALTH Act does not limit in any way an award of economic damages to injured victims. As for legitimate cases of medical malpractice, nothing in the HEALTH Act prevents juries from awarding very large amounts to victims, including children, Smith said. H.R. 5 is supported by some 200 organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American College of Nurse Practitioners, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Council of Womens and Infants Specialty Hospitals. A full transcript of Rep. Smiths floor remarks on H.R. 5 can be found at https://www.lamarsmith.house.gov/News.asp?FormMode=Detail&ID=697
07.28.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) praised the Energy Policy Act of 2005 today and stated the legislation will help the nation reduce its dependence on foreign oil. The bill passed the House of Representatives on Thursday by 275 to 156.Smith said the bill contains a number of provisions aimed to encourage the development of renewable sources of energy like hydroelectricity, landfill gas, ocean power, and biomass, as well as a provision he cosponsored that encourages Americans to invest in solar power."Solar energy is a long-term, environmentally-friendly alternative to the worlds limited energy sources. Not only does it reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it also reduces our reliance on other nonrenewable energy sources, like coal, which pollutes the environment. Solar energy is clean, renewable, and reliable, said Smith.For those who invest in solar energy, the bill provides a tax credit equaling 30 percent of the value of the expenditure of the system for the given year. It also includes the same 30 percent credit for those who invest in solar water heaters for their homes. This will help offset the costs of solar energy collecting and power generating devices, added Smith.The development of solar and other renewable energy sources is an investment in our future. It will save our natural resources, decrease pollution, and improve national security, Smith concluded.
07.28.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $500,000 for the city of Austins Clean Water Program. The funds were included in the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the House Thursday by a vote of 410 to 10.The funds will be used for the inspection, cleaning and evaluation of Travis Countys sewer system. Smith has secured more than $1.7 million over the last three years for the project. My office has worked with local officials for several years to improve Austins water quality. I am pleased we were able to secure another round of funds for this vital project, said Smith.In recent years, overflows in the system have affected public drinking water, everyday activities such as watering lawns, and local water activities like fishing in near by creeks. These spills threaten the countys public health and subject the city to EPA fines, said Smith. Without federal assistance, city taxpayers would be faced with the possibility of paying up to $150 million in fines to the Environmental Protection Agency if the sewer infrastructure is not upgraded, added Smith. The Austin Clean Water Program was created after the Environmental Protection Agency ordered the city to eliminate and prevent sewage spills by 2008. The funds Smith obtained will go to the Clean Water Programs Sanitary Sewer Overflow Prevention Program.
07.28.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today announced that he has obtained $500,000 to help expand the boundaries of the Balcones Canyonland Wildlife Refuge. The funds were included in the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed the House Thursday by a vote of 410 to 10.Said Smith, These funds will be used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to aid in the acquisition of a 623-acre conservation easement to help complete the boundaries of the refuge and protect endangered species.The Balcones Canyonland Wildlife refuge offers our region a variety of opportunities to experience the wonders and beauty of wildlife in their habitat. I look forward to the completion of this important project, added Smith.Balcones Canyonlands Refuge is located in the Texas Hill Country northwest of Austin.
07.26.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith introduced the following resolution today congratulating Lance Armstrong on his seventh Tour de France victory. Congressmen John Carter, Lloyd Doggett, and Michael McCaul are cosponsors of the measure. RESOLUTION Congratulating Lance Armstrong on his seventh Tour de France victory and his retirement and recognizing his dedication to helping others. Whereas, on July 24, 2005, Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France, the most prestigious race in competitive cycling; Whereas, Lance Armstrong competed against the worlds best cyclists for three weeks, covering more than 2,000 miles of difficult and imposing terrain in France and Germany through changing weather conditions; Whereas, his victory in 2005 is the seventh Tour de France win for Lance Armstrong, establishing a new record for the event; Whereas, Lance Armstrong overcame seemingly insurmountable challenges in life to reach the pinnacle of his cycling career; Whereas, Lance Armstrongs achievements are proof that hard work and perseverance can turn dreams into reality; Whereas, after his victory Lance Armstrong announced that he will retire from the sport; Whereas, Lance Armstrong has demonstrated the same level of commitment to improving and enriching the lives of fellow cancer survivors as he has training for the Tour de France, and; Whereas, his devotion to providing cancer survivors with the tools and knowledge to live strong through the Lance Armstrong Foundation is recognized throughout the United States and the world; Now, therefore be it resolved, that the House of Representatives congratulates Lance Armstrong on his seventh Tour de France victory and his well deserved retirement and recognizes his dedication to helping others.
07.26.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) cheered the launch of the space shuttle Discovery today and commended the efforts of NASAs employees and its numerous contractors who labored to return the nation to manned spaceflight. Smith is a member of the House Science Committees Subcommittee on Space.The launch of the shuttle Discovery represents a proud step forward for NASA. Since the loss of the Columbia and her brave crew, return to flight has been a personal mission for countless individuals involved in our space program, said Smith.Their dedication to exploration and commitment to excellence have guided us to this moment. The pride and hopes of this nation ride with Discovery today, noted Smith.Congratulations to all the scientists, technicians, engineers, support personal, astronauts and contractors who made this event possible. Discoverys crew builds upon Americas great space faring tradition and furthers mankinds natural instinct to explore, concluded Smith.
07.22.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX), a senior member of the House Science Committees Subcommittee on Space, made the following remarks on the floor of the House of Representatives today in support of H.R. 3070, the NASA Authorization Act: Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the NASA Authorization bill, as do most Americans. A recent Gallup survey shows that almost 80% of the American people support space exploration. As the country gathers to witness NASAs return to flight and the launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery, a new generation of young people will be inspired and older generations will honor the pioneers of the Apollo program. The launch of space shuttle Discovery is historic. It represents the first step toward our bold new vision for space exploration: A vision that takes us and our international partners back to the International Space Station, returns our nation to the surface of the Moon, and directs our gaze towards Mars and beyond. The exploration of space is about hope, imagination, and new technology. The Space Shuttle and research programs on the International Space Station will help maintain our nations leadership role in a globally competitive industry. Americans of all ages and backgrounds support our human spaceflight program because they have a clear understanding that it has changed our lives and is critical to our nations future. The launch of Discovery and continued research on the International Space Station are part of the Vision that will carry us to new frontiers in space and technology. Mr. Chairman, I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.
07.21.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX), a senior member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, made the following remarks on the floor of the House of Representatives today in support of H.R. 3199, the PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act:Mr. Speaker, I support the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005.The continued threat of a terrorism attack in the United States and this months terrorist attacks in London remind us of the need to prevent, investigate, and prosecute acts of terror. The PATRIOT Act was a long overdue measure that enhanced our ability to collect crucial intelligence information on the global terrorist network. It passed by a margin of 98-1 in the Senate and 357-66 in the House. Even the American Civil Liberties Union stated in an April 5, 2005, news release that, most of the voluminous PATRIOT Act is actually unobjectionable from a civil liberties point of view. . . . the law makes important changes that give law enforcement agents the tools they need to protect against terrorist attacks.Many of the tools the Act provides to law enforcement officials have been used for decades to fight organized crime and drug dealers. They have been reviewed and approved by the courts and found Constitutional. For instance, prior to the PATRIOT Act, the FBI could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia, but they could not get one to investigate terrorists. Whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists. America is a safer country today than before September 11, 2001, because of the PATRIOT Act. Giving the Department of Justice, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the FBI information-sharing powers enabled law enforcement officials to disrupt terrorist cells in New York, Oregon, Florida and Virginia. Since September 11, 2001, over 200 people charged with crimes stemming from international terrorist investigations have been convicted or have pled guilty. The PATRIOT Act helped investigators in Texas apprehend an individual who threatened to attack a mosque. Our success in preventing another attack on the American homeland would have been less likely without the PATRIOT Act. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies must continue to have the powers they need to protect all Americans.
07.19.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX), a member and former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Claims, today said he has many concerns about the Kyl−Cornyn Comprehensive Enforcement and Immigration Reform Act introduced today. Senators Kyl and Cornyn should be commended for drafting an immigration reform alternative to the McCain−Kennedy guest worker legislation that includes serious enforcement measures. Its an improvement on other bills, particularly because it does not provide a way for illegal immigrants to obtain legal permanent residence, in other words, amnesty. However, I still have many concerns with the legislation, Smith said.There is no cap on the number of foreign workers who will be able to take advantage of a guest worker program. There are between 10 and 20 million illegal aliens living in the United States. I dont think the American people want such a massive program without understanding its impact on wages, social services, hospitals, schools, and taxpayers, added Smith.These workers will be able to work in any occupation. Nearly every study shows that competition from cheap foreign labor undercuts the wages of American workers and legal immigrants. Rather than importing cheap foreign labor, we should increase wages and make these jobs more attractive to American workers, Smith noted.Guest worker programs can also be a threat to homeland security. They make it easy for potential terrorists to enter the country legally and stay. Its already happened. One of the terrorists who blew up the garage of the World Trade Center in 1993 did just that under an earlier program, commented Smith.Smith added, This guest worker program may not be temporary. Illegal immigrants already in the country can stay for as long as five years and their families can visit. Does anyone really believe they are going home? Guest worker programs sound good, but they only compound the already serious troubles that illegal immigration causes, Smith concluded.
07.19.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property and the Co-Chairman of the Judicial Accountability Working Group, today commended President Bushs choice for the next Supreme Court justice, Judge John Roberts Jr. of the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.John Roberts is a judge of impeccable character who has dedicated his legal career to the betterment of our nations judicial system, noted Smith.The Supreme Court is not elected, and it is therefore not a proper arbiter of social policy. I believe Judge Roberts to be the type of justice who will decide cases based on the intent of our Constitutional framers, and will refrain from inserting his own political and social ideology into his decisions, Smith said.Throughout this process, I call on the Senate to cooperate with the President in quickly moving Judge Roberts through the confirmation process and to his seat on the bench, concluded Smith.
07.01.2005	The U.S. House of Representatives late Thursday unanimously approved a resolution sponsored by San Antonio Congressman Lamar Smith congratulating the Spurs on their 2005 NBA Championship victory. Smith was joined on the resolution by Congressmen Henry Bonilla, Charles Gonzalez, and Henry Cuellar.

06.27.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today commended the 2005 College World Series Champions, the University of Texas Longhorns, on the floor of the House of Representatives. Smith made the following remarks:Mr. Speaker, its a privilege to congratulate the nations 2005 College World Series champions, the University of Texas Longhorns.This is an amazing sixth national title for the Longhorns. It also represents a record 32nd trip to the College World Series. The Longhorns win caps off another impressive season of University of Texas baseball. The team had a combined 51−16 record in the regular season and the playoffs, setting up another opportunity to compete for the national championship.Under the guidance of Coach Augie Garrido, the Longhorns went undefeated in their five games of the series, pulling off a 6-2 victory over the Florida Gators in the final match-up on Sunday.Credit for this outstanding victory is due to the entire Longhorns baseball team, coaching staff, and the athletic department at the University of Texas. Special recognition for the win is also owed to the most outstanding player of the series, third baseman David Maroul. His six hits and six runs were a major factor in the Longhorns championship win.Mr. Speaker, congratulations go to Coach Garrido and all the Longhorn players on their great victory.
06.27.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, today released the following statement concerning the Supreme Courts Grokster vs. MGM decision:This is a huge victory for Americas creators. I am pleased that the Supreme Court recognizes the need to protect American innovation, said Smith. Piracy and intellectual property theft cost American businesses billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs each year. A problem exists when the vast majority of people who would never shoplift a CD at a record store think nothing of downloading entire albums from peer-to-peer networks without paying for them, said Smith.Both shoplifting and illegally downloading copyrighted materials are wrong and represent a direct threat to artists, software developers, and others whose livelihoods depend on their creations, Smith noted.The Court today fired a broadside blow at online pirates. This will protect those who create, innovate, and invent, commented Smith.In the weeks to come, the Intellectual Property Subcommittee will analyze the Courts decision and its implications, Smith concluded.
06.27.2005	Congressmen Lamar Smith (R−TX) and Steve Chabot (R−OH), co−chairmen of the House Judicial Accountability Working Group (JAWG), today released the following statements regarding the Supreme Courts Ten Commandments decision:While I am pleased that the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments display on the grounds of the Texas Capitol in Austin, I am disappointed that the display in the Kentucky courthouse was not given the same respect, said Smith. The Ten Commandments are an integral part of our society, history, values and legal system. Unfortunately, the Court has erred on the side of activists bent on banishing all forms of public religious recognition. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, not freedom from religion, commented Smith.States should have the opportunity to appropriately display and recognize the historical importance of the Commandments, be it on state capitol grounds or in our nations courtrooms, Smith noted.To not recognize the influence of the Ten Commandments on our legal system is to ignore the principles on which our nation was founded, Smith concluded. The Ten Commandments are symbols of all societys commitment to live by a guiding set of principles. These principles, which are implicit in our Constitution, represent the ideals on which our founding fathers came to this country and sought to protect through the First Amendment, said Chabot.Thus, while I am pleased by the courts ruling in Van Orden v. Perry upholding the display of the Ten Commandments on government property, I am deeply disappointed in the courts contradictory decision in McCreary County, KY v. ACLU, noted Chabot.I continue to believe that as members of Congress we have a duty to protect these ideals, the vision of our founding fathers, and the authority of the Constitution, Chabot concluded.
06.24.2005	In recognition of the San Antonio Spurs third NBA Championship victory Thursday night, Congressman Lamar Smith introduced the following resolution in the House of Representatives. Smith was joined on the resolution by Reps. Bonilla, Gonzalez, and Cuellar. In addition, Smith entered a statement into the Congressional record, also included below: Resolution Congratulating the San Antonio Spurs for winning the 2005 National Basketball Association Championship Whereas on June 23, 2005, the San Antonio Spurs won the National Basketball Associations (NBA) Championship with an 81“74 victory over the Detroit Pistons; Whereas the Spurs win resulted in their third NBA championship title in franchise history; Whereas the Spurs competed against the Pistons to win the series 4“3; Whereas the Detroit Pistons and their coach, Larry Brown, put up a battle worthy of a championship series; Whereas under the guidance of Coach Gregg Popovich, the Spurs Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, Robert Horry, Bruce Bowen, Nazr Mohammed, Brent Barry, Beno Udrih, Rasho Nesterovic, Glenn Robinson, Devin Brown, and Tony Massenburg played valiantly to bring the NBA trophy back home to San Antonio; Whereas congratulations are due as well to the Spurs owners, Peter and Julianna Holt, and all of the other people in the Spurs organization;Whereas Tim Duncan was for the third time named the finals Most Valuable Player following the Spurs victory; Whereas Coach Gregg Popovich is only one of two active coaches to win three championship titles and only the fifth in league history; and Whereas San Antonio has the best hometown crowd in the league and the Alamo City is the perfect setting for a championship celebration: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, that the House of Representatives congratulates the San Antonio Spurs and Coach Gregg Popovich for another exciting basketball season and for winning the 2005 National Basketball Association Championship. Congressman Lamar Smith Statement for the Record In Honor of the NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs Mr. Speaker, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise today to recognize our 2005 National Basketball Association champions, the San Antonio Spurs. After going head to head for six games, the Spurs and the Detroit Pistons met for their final showdown in San Antonio Thursday night. In front of their hometown crowd, the Spurs demonstrated once again why they are the best team in the nation. Following a tight and evenly matched first half, the Spurs pulled away from the Pistons in the final quarter to win 81−74 over Detroit, closing out an incredibly hard fought championship series four games to three. Congratulations are also due to the Detroit Pistons and their coach, Larry Brown, for putting up a battle worthy of a championship series. With the NBAs number one and number two defensive teams battling against one another for the title, this was an exciting game not only for the Alamo City, but for fans around the nation and in more than 200 nations around the world where sports fans watched and cheered. Under the guidance of Coach Gregg Popovich, the Spurs Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, Robert Horry, Bruce Bowen, Nazr Mohammed, Brent Barry, Beno Udrih, Rasho Nesterovic, Glenn Robinson, Devin Brown, and Tony Massenburg played valiantly to bring the NBA trophy back home to San Antonio. My congratulations go as well to the Spurs owners, Peter and Julianna Holt, as well as the many other people in the Spurs organization. Much credit is due to Tim Duncan, who with twenty−five points and eleven rebounds, was appropriately named the Most Valuable Player of the Finals series. This marks the third time he has won the award for his outstanding athletic skills and leadership and performance on the court.This is the Spurs third championship victory in franchise history. They won their first in 1999, followed by their second in 2003. Three titles in seven years isnt just a magnificent accomplishment − its a basketball dynasty. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate and thank Coach Popovich and all the Spurs players for an unforgettable season.
06.21.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that he has obtained $19.2 million for defense related projects in the 21st Congressional District. The funds are part of the FY 2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which passed the House of Representatives late Monday night. This is positive news for our region. These projects will improve homeland security, strengthen our military, protect our soldiers, and help local economies, said Smith.This is just the beginning of the appropriations process, Smith noted. The funding levels could decrease when the Senate takes up the bill. I will continue working to ensure that these programs are properly funded.The $19.2 million obtained by Smith includes:¢$3 million for Southwest Research Institute, Applied Nanotech Inc., the University of Texas, San Antonio, and other partners to develop specialized clothing and tools suitable for dangerous environments, including chemical and biological threats and fire hazards;¢$2.5 million to Nanotechnologies, Inc. to further develop a weaponry system that will aid troops in urban warfare scenarios;¢$2.7 million for a Nanotechnologies, Inc. and Brooks City Base project to further implement nanotechnology based systems that detect and neutralize chemical and biological agents; ¢$2 million to integrate software designed by Austin Info Systems for the U.S. Army to improve intelligence gathering and target identification capabilities; ¢$4 million to Austin Info Systems to complete a DOD project that electronically enhances the militarys tactical situational awareness and mission planning abilities;¢$3 million to QuickFlex, Inc. to develop a system that allows silicone chips to reprogram and reconfigure themselves while running software applications;¢$2 million for the Flexible Display Initiative, designed to create a durable, field-worthy, flexible display for communication systems.
06.16.2005	With the San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons battling it out in the NBA finals, fans from both cities are on edge, wondering just how many games they are away from calling their city the home of the 2005 NBA National Champions.While the outcome of the contest is days away from being determined, two members of the House of Representatives are anxiously waiting for the final buzzer. They are U.S. Reps. Lamar Smith of San Antonio and John Conyers of Detroit. Both Congressmen are devoted NBA fans and proudly tout their teams strengths and past NBA championships. And both members are confident that their hometown team will be victorious − so confident that they have made a little wager. It doesnt involve money. Nor does it involve lunch or dinner in a members favorite restaurant. Its about losing something that neither member is ready to give up very easily: their pride. They have agreed that whatever the outcome, the member who represents the losing city should suffer some form of indignity. Therefore it has been decided that the loser will don the winning teams hat for a joint picture on the steps of the nations Capitol. Now I know that John believes the Pistons recent win represents a turning point for his team, but I have to warn him not to get his hopes too high, commented Smith.With the Spurs jumping all over their crankcase, the Pistons simply arent going to be able to fire on all cylinders, said Smith.The Pistons are going to need a tune−up after its all over, Smith noted.Conyers responded to Smith's comments with the following, While the Spurs may cause a little pain in the Pistons side, well be a little too busy ˜goin to work and winning another championship to be distracted. Spurs never fit on work boots anyway.
06.08.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today introduced the Patent Reform Act of 2005, legislation to improve the quality of patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and to reform certain patent practices that disrupt the operations of high−tech companies and other businesses. The bill in its current form is, without question, the most comprehensive change to U.S. patent law since Congress passed the 1952 Patent Act, said Smith.The Intellectual Property Subcommittee has undertaken such responsibility because the changes are necessary to bolster the U.S. economy and improve the quality of living for all Americans, Smith noted.The bill will eliminate legal gamesmanship from the current system that rewards lawsuit abuses over creativity. It will enhance the quality of patents and increase public confidence in their legal integrity, said Smith. This will help individuals and companies obtain seed money for research, commercialize their inventions, grow their businesses, create new jobs, and offer the American public a dazzling array of products and services that make our country the envy of the world, Smith commented. All businesses, small and large, will benefit. All industries directly or indirectly affected by patents, including finance, automotive manufacturing, high-tech, and pharmaceuticals, will profit, Smith noted. The bill is a good first-cut of what we envisioned when this process commenced. No doubt, it will undergo changes as we proceed to markup, Smith concluded. The Patent Act:¢Provides that the right to a patent will be awarded to the first inventor to file for a patent who provides an adequate disclosure for a claimed invention;¢Simplifies the process by which an applicant takes an oath governing the particulars of an invention and the identity of the rightful inventor; ¢Deletes the best mode requirement from §112 of the Patent Act, which lists certain specifications that an inventor must set forth in an application;¢Codifies the law related to inequitable conduct in connection with patent proceedings before the PTO;¢Clarifies the rights of an inventor to damages for patent infringement;¢Authorizes courts with jurisdiction over patent cases to grant injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity to prevent the violation of patent rights;¢Authorizes the PTO to limit by regulation the circumstances in which patent applicants may file a continuation and still be entitled to priority date of the parent application;¢Expands the 18 month publication feature to all applications;¢Creates a new post−grant opposition system;¢Allows third-party submission of prior art within six months after the date of publication of the patent application.
05.25.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) today announced that the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (LARA) passed the House Judiciary Committee and is now headed to the House floor for consideration. LARA will reduce the filing of frivolous lawsuits.The alarming spread of frivolous lawsuits has made a mockery of our legal system. Frivolous suits are brought despite no evidence that shows negligence on the part of the defendant. These are nuisance lawsuits, but costly to the defendants, Smith said.Many Americans have legitimate legal grievances and deserve their day in court. Justice should not be denied to those who deserve it. However, some lawyers game the system, which drives up the cost of doing business and drives down the integrity of the judicial system, added Smith. Today almost any party can bring any suit in practically any jurisdiction because plaintiffs and their attorneys have nothing to lose. All they want is for the defendant to settle. This is legalized extortion. It is lawsuit lottery, said Smith. Our national motto might as well be: When in doubt, file a lawsuit.While plaintiffs have nothing to lose and everything to gain by working the system this way, defendants, on the other hand, often stand to lose everything. They can unfairly lose their careers, their businesses and their reputations. This is not justice. But the there is a remedy: the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, concluded Smith.The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (H.R. 420):¢ Requires judges to sanction attorneys or parties who file frivolous lawsuits; ¢ Permits judges to order plaintiffs to reimburse reasonable litigation costs, including attorneys fees;¢ Reduces court-friendly shopping by requiring plaintiffs to sue only where they live or were injured, or where the defendant's principal place of business is located.
05.23.2005	U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith circulated a letter today that was also signed by 14 other members of the Texas Congressional Delegation urging Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to allow an up or down vote on the confirmation of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Smith was joined on the letter by Reps. Ralph Hall, Joe Barton, John Culberson, Louie Gohmert, Sam Johnson, Kevin Brady, Michael McCaul, Jeb Hensarling, Randy Neugebauer, Mac Thornberry, Kenny Marchant, John Carter, Kay Granger, and Henry Bonilla.Dear Minority Leader Reid, We urge you to allow a vote on the confirmation of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Owen was nominated for the federal court of appeals in May of 2001; however, she still has not received a vote on the Senate floor. There is no question Justice Owen is a qualified candidate and dedicated public servant. She has served on the Texas Supreme Court for the last ten years. Throughout her career, she has worked to provide legal services to the poor and to educate parents about divorce and lessen its impact on children. She has been praised by members of both parties for her service. John Hill, a former Democratic Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas, stated, After years of closely observing Justice Owens work, I can assert with confidence that her approach to judicial decision-making is restrained, that her opinions are fair and well reasoned, and that her integrity is beyond reproach¦. I know personally just how impeccable Justice Owens credentials are. During her last election in 2000, Justice Owen was supported by a larger percentage of Texans than any of her colleagues and was endorsed by every major Texas newspaper. Her nomination is strongly supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators. We hope you will allow her nomination to proceed to the Senate floor for a vote without delay.
05.20.2005	Texas Congressmen Lamar Smith (R) and John Carter (R) today announced that the Department of Homeland Security spending bill that recently passed the House includes language that ensures the agency will properly interpret reforms to the H-1B visa program authored by Smith last year. Carter, a member of the Appropriations Committee and co−sponsor of the bill, succeeded in including the language in the bill as it moved through the appropriations process.The H-1B visa allows immigrants who are highly skilled and proficient in specialty occupations to be temporarily employed in the United States for up to six years. In an effort to help companies meet their need for such workers, Smith worked to pass legislation in 2004 that added 20,000 H-1B visa applicants who hold Masters or Ph.D. degrees from universities in the United States over and above the annual 65,000 limit on H−1B issuances. The Department of Homeland Security, however, has decided that beginning in fiscal year 2006, it will interpret the language of the legislation so that these additional 20,000 individuals will be counted as part of the 65,000 H-1B cap from the outset, instead of after the cap has been reached. This interpretation, according to Smith, is not in accordance with the intent of his bill. Its effect is to allow the additional 20,000 visas to go to lower−educated workers rather than the higher−educated workers who were intended.The purpose of the legislation was to ensure that high-tech companies have the highly educated engineers, scientists, researchers, and educators they need to develop products, remain competitive, and continue to grow here in the United States. Over 80 percent of H-1B visa holders working in higher education, medicine, and scientific research and development have a Masters degree or higher. This language ensures that the original intent of the legislation is carried out and that our companies workforce needs are met, said Smith. Said Carter, Our high tech industry needs highly educated workers, specifically in science and math, to help drive the innovation and ideas that fuel our economy. I felt it was important to clarify the intent of this language. By providing that the H-1B visas go to the most highly educated applicants, we will ensure the ideas of tomorrow have the label 'Made in the USA.'At the advanced degree level, over half of math and engineering degrees awarded in the United States in 2004 went to foreign nationals. Our universities train and invest in these students while they are here in the United States. Once they graduate, we must provide them with the kinds of opportunities that will make them want to stay rather than allowing them to work for our foreign competitors, Smith noted.
05.12.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today voted to support the Faster and Smarter Funding for First Responders Act. The legislation, H.R. 1544, overhauls the current system for first responder grants and follows the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission to allow for greater allocation on the basis of a states or regions vulnerability to terrorist attack. The House of Representatives approved the measure 409−10.Smith, who serves on the House Homeland Security Committee, stated, The current broken formula has adversely affected Texas. In federal funding per capita for first responders, Texas ranks fiftieth of the fifty states despite the fact that Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio are three of the nations ten largest cities. Also, Texas has a 1,200 mile porous border with Mexico, 14 maritime ports, and an airport “ Dallas Fort Worth “ that is bigger than New York Citys Manhattan Island. Clearly Texas faces a more grave threat than some other parts of the country, commented Smith. The bill provides assistance to first responders serving where the risk is greatest, determines the essential capabilities of communities, and encourages regional cooperation and mutual aid agreements through regional grant applications, Smith noted.These changes to the current grant allocation procedure are essential if we are to be ready for another attack. We hope all of this preparation will be for nothing, but we must be prepared. H.R. 1544 ensures that we are as prepared as possible, Smith concluded.
05.06.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) was named to U.S. Border Controls ˜Honor Roll list for his perfect voting record on border and immigration issues. USBCs mission is to end illegal immigration by securing the nations borders and reforming border and immigration policies. Congressman Smith has distinguished himself by scoring 100% on all House bills and amendments that U.S. Border Control has selected in its voting analysis of legislation critical to reforming Americas border and immigration policies, USBC Chairman Edward I. Nelson said.In recognition of his service to the nation, Smith has been placed on U.S. Border Controls Honor Roll, an honor conferred on fifty-one Members of the 108th Congress. A complete listing can be found on Border Controls website (https://www.usbc.org/).Nelson continued, The people in this district are fortunate to have such a Member of Congress working for their best interests. In this the 109th Congress there is much to be done to secure our borders against drugs, disease, terrorism and illegal immigration, while developing sensible and fair immigration policies."I am honored to receive this recognition from U.S. Border Control, and I applaud their work to protect this country," Smith said. "I will continue to work to strengthen our borders and promote the enforcement of current and future laws against illegal immigration."U.S. Border Control is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization, established in 1986. U.S. Border Control educates the public on issues related to protecting the sovereignty of the United States. These include the establishment and maintenance of effective border integrity systems, economic policies, national defense practices, and immigration policies focusing on ending illegal immigration by securing the nations borders and reforming immigration policies.
05.04.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today joined fellow members of the House Republican High-Tech Working Group to announce their priorities for the 109th Congress. Smith, who serves as vice−chairman, detailed the need to reform the patent system and improve intellectual property protection. Smith is the chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.The Patent and Trademark Office does not receive the attention that other government agencies receive. It should. This office is critical to the health of our economy and to the lives of millions of Americans, Smith said. From the lone individual working in their garage to the small business person with a breakthrough idea to the large high-tech company that applies for hundreds of patents, all rely on a responsive PTO. The Intellectual Property Subcommittee has held two hearings on draft legislation to address flaws in the patent system. I plan to continue to work with industry in the next few weeks to develop a bill that will improve PTO operations and patent quality, noted Smith.Smith added that protection of intellectual property has and will continue to be a strong priority for the working group. Whether its movies, music, software, or telecommunications devices, the intellectual property industries drive our economy. Without adequate protection, there will be no incentive to create and the economy and job creation will be hurt, Smith said. We must ensure our laws protect our nations intellectual property, and that they are enforced. Without adequate enforcement, piracy and counterfeiting will continue to skyrocket, Smith added. We must also work internationally to ensure that other nations respect the property of our innovators. U.S. creators face a significant amount of piracy abroad, Smith said. The International Intellectual Property Alliance recently reported that U.S. industries lose an estimated $25 “ 30 billion worldwide due to piracy. We cannot expect to increase U.S. jobs and our economic growth in the face of piracy levels this high, Smith concluded.
04.28.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−TX) today successfully offered an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act to establish a university-based Center for Excellence for Border Security. Fellow Texas Congressman Michael McCaul (R) also lent his support to the amendment.Smith offered the amendment during the Homeland Security Committees consideration of the nations first ever comprehensive annual Department of Homeland Security authorization legislation. The multi-faceted Center will offer guidance and solutions to the Department of Homeland Security on the most effective means to enhance border security. This will be accomplished by emphasizing border security technology, conducting research and providing educational tools to the department, said Smith. I also want to recognize and thank Congressman McCaul for his strong support of this amendment and commitment to this issue. I applaud Chairman Smith for offering the United States a permanent way to stay current and educated on immigration and border security issues. As the former Chief of Counter Terrorism with the Justice Department, whose jurisdiction included the Mexican border, I experienced first hand the ever-growing problems with this part of our nation. I am pleased to have helped bring this amendment to the floor, stated McCaul.Since its establishment, the Homeland Security Department has worked tirelessly to secure our borders. However, the U.S.-Mexican border and the U.S.-Canadian border each pose their own unique set of challenges, said Smith. For example, the U.S.-Mexico border includes metropolitan areas and large portions of uninhabited territory that make it vulnerable to direct attacks and terrorist infiltrations. Smith noted that in Texas, the border stretches 1,200 miles and consists of major free trade routes, 14 Texas-Mexico sister cities, 11 border ports of entry, and 24 actual border crossings. Texas has worked with the federal governments border security entities, collaborated with Mexico and Central America, and created a smart border “ using advanced technology, multidisciplinary research and communication. This amendment establishes a Center to duplicate these efforts and successes on a national scale, Smith said. Placing this Border Security Center at the university level will allow flexibility in conducting research and developing real life applications normally restricted to the private sector, Smith added.While the ultimate location of the Center of Excellence will have to be determined according to guidelines set by the Department of Homeland Security, Smith added that given Texas familiarity with border issues, the University of Texas System is a prime example of where such a center would be successful.
04.27.2005	President George W. Bush signed Congressman Lamar Smiths (R−TX) Family Entertainment and Copyright Act into law today. Included in the legislation is the Family Movie Act, which allows parents to use technology to shield their children from profanity, sex and violence in movies watched at home.Smith, who participated in the signing ceremony with the President in the Oval Office said, The Presidents signature on this bill caps almost a year long effort to help parents decide for themselves what their children watch in the family room. Raising children may be the toughest job in the world. Parents need all the help they can get. This Family Movie Act establishes that using technology to skip over a movies video or audio content does not violate federal copyright law.The technology this legislation addresses does not alter any movies content. But it does allow parents to skip over content they believe is offensive. Its the electronic equivalent of using a remote control to mute the sound or fast-forward over sex, violence and profanity, noted Smith.Parents have a right to protect their children from sex, violence, and profanity in movies. The Family Movie Act ensures that they have such rights, Smith said.The Act also contains several legislative provisions to protect copyrighted works, including the Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act and the Preservation of Orphans Works Act. The Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act will deter the growing practice of using handheld technology to record and distribute movies by making it a felony to record a movie in a theater. It will also make it a violation to distribute a copyrighted work prior to its release or commercial distribution.The protection of intellectual property rights is vital to the movie industry. This bill is necessary to ensure that all those involved in the production of a film, from the director to the set carpenter, are not cheated out of their just compensation. It is vital to protect creative works, Smith said.The Orphan Works Act ensures that libraries and archives have greater access to copyrighted works.Smith is the Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property.
04.19.2005	The House of Representatives approved Congressman Lamar Smiths (R−TX) Family Entertainment and Copyright Act today, clearing the way for the legislation to be signed into law. Included in the bill is the Family Movie Act, which allows parents to use technology to shield their children from offensive movie content at home. I feel strongly that parents should decide for themselves what their children see and hear on television. These days, I dont think anyone would even consider buying a DVD player that doesnt come with a remote control. Yet there are some who would deny parents the right to use the equivalent electronic device that would protect their children from sex, violence, and profanity in movies watched at home, Smith said.Raising children may be the toughest job in the world. Parents need all the help they can get. And they should be able to determine what their children see on the screen, commented Smith.The Family Movie Act permits the use of an electronic device, incorporated into a DVD player, which allows parents to skip or mute objectionable content at home without violating copyright law.Yes, we parents might mute dialogue that others deem crucial or we might fast-forward over scenes that others consider essential. But thats irrelevant. Parents should be able to mute or skip over anything they want if they feel its in the best interests of their children. And, as a practical matter, parents cannot monitor their childrens viewing habits all the time, Smith noted. Just as the author of a book should not be able to force someone to read that book in any particular manner or order, a studio or director should not be able to force our children to watch a movie in a particular way, Smith added. No one can argue with a straight face that it should be against the law to skip over a few pages or even entire chapters of a book. So, too, it should not be illegal to skip over a few words or scenes in a movie. The Family Movie Act ensures that parents have such rights, Smith said. The Act also contains several legislative provisions to protect copyrighted works, including the Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act and the Preservation of Orphans Works Act. The Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act creates new penalties for those who camcord movies in public theaters and who willfully infringe copyright law by distributing copies of pre-release movies or other works online.The Orphan Works Act ensures that libraries and archives have greater access to copyrighted works.Smith is the Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property.
04.13.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R−San Antonio) today voted to permanently repeal the punitive death tax. More formally known as the estate tax, the death tax is imposed at the time of a persons death. Our families are better off when they keep more of what they earn. One way to let them to do that is for Congress to pass the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act, Smith said on the House floor.Collecting this tax often prevents parents from passing along their lifes work and savings to their children. Family farms, ranches and small businesses must be sold to satisfy the death tax. The rates can reach 55%, said Smith. Not surprisingly, nearly all small business owners favor permanent repeal of the death tax.The Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act (H.R. 8) removes the expiration or sunset provision of the death tax repeal from the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, which Congress passed in 2001. Congress took the first step toward death tax repeal in 2001 when it temporarily wiped the tax off the books. But unless Congress permanently repeals the tax, it will be reinstated in 2011.Thats not only bad tax policy, its also bad for families and small businesses, Smith noted.No one should be taxed throughout their lifetime and then have their property re-taxed at the time of their death, Smith said.Its the wrong tax, at the wrong time, on the wrong people, Smith concluded.
04.13.2005	Congressmen Lamar Smith (R-TX) and Brad Sherman (D−CA) introduced the Faster FOIA Act today as part of their ongoing effort to make government information more accessible to the American people. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Patrick Leahy (D−VT) are the bills sponsors in the Senate.American citizens should have the opportunity to quickly and easily obtain information from the federal government. This promotes a responsive democracy, Smith noted. The Faster FOIA Act establishes a 16-member commission that recommends to Congress and the President ways to reduce delays in processing requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Freedom of Information Act created a system for the public to access government records. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining such information is overly burdensome and federal agencies have become less and less responsive to citizens requests. This deters citizens from seeking information to which they are entitled, Smith said. The Faster FOIA Act removes unnecessary delays in the FOIA process.The Act augments legislation introduced by Smith earlier this year to strengthen the FOIA. Known as the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act or OPEN Government Act, it reinforces existing FOIA provisions and creates strong incentives for federal agencies to comply with the law.The OPEN Government Act:¢ Tightens up time limits for government agencies to respond to FOIA requests.¢ Creates a new Office of Government Information Services to ensure that FOIA requests in all government agencies are promptly and thoroughly handled. ¢ Requires government agencies to implement a system that enables individuals to track their request for information. ¢ Allows more individuals to recover attorneys fees when they are on the winning side of litigation to get information from the government.¢ Creates a broader definition of news media so that all types of news media, including smaller, non-traditional outlets, can obtain government documents at minimal cost.Modernizing FOIA ensures that government remains open and accountable to the people, Smith concluded.
03.17.2005	The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today presented Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) with its 2005 SIA Congressional Leadership Award for his outstanding contributions to the U.S. semiconductor industry. Smith received the award for his effective work on a broad range of issues important to the industry. These include workforce issues, intellectual property protection, education, funding for basic research, employee stock options and broadband deployment. Congressman Lamar Smith has been a staunch and effective advocate for the U.S. semiconductor industry, said SIA President George Scalise. His authorship of the American Workforce Improvement and Jobs Protection bill, and his work to exempt 20,000 graduates of Masters and PhD programs from the H1-B visa cap, were extremely important to our industry. Access to a workforce educated in engineering, mathematics, and the physical sciences is critical to our industrys international competitiveness. I want to thank the Semiconductor Industry Association for this honor, Smith said. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Intellectual Property Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to work closely with many members of SIA on crucial high tech issues. I appreciate their dedication to advancing the U.S. chip industry. The SIA presents awards each year at its annual Washington conference to public policy makers who have helped advance the SIAs public policy goals and to university professors who have made important contributions to semiconductor research. The SIA is the leading voice for the semiconductor industry and has represented U.S. semiconductor companies since 1977. Collectively, the chip industry employs a domestic workforce of 255,000 people.
03.15.2005	The Defenders of Property Rights today presented Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) with its Defender of Property Rights award for his work to protect intellectual property. Smith is the Chairman of the Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. It is an honor to receive this recognition from Defenders of Property Rights, Smith said. Intellectual property represents a large sector of the economy, employing more than 4 million Americans. As our nation continues to shift from an industrial economy to an information-based economy, our economic assets are increasingly based in intellectual property. We must encourage its continued growth and protection, Smith noted.Property owners, be they land owners or the owners of intellectual property rights, have no better friend in Congress than Rep. Lamar Smith, according to Nancie G. Marzulla, President of Defenders of Property Rights. We are delighted to be able to recognize him for his outstanding leadership in protecting property rights. Defenders of Property Rights was founded in 1991 to counterbalance the governmental threat to private property from a broad range of regulations. The group is the only national public-interest legal foundation dedicated exclusively to the protection of constitutionally guaranteed rights in property.
03.11.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that he has obtained $16 million for transportation projects along the I-35 corridor. The funds are part of the Transportation Equity Act, which passed the House of Representatives late Thursday. The $16 million secured in the House bill by Rep. Smith includes:$6 million for State Highway 130: This funding will be used to complete the southern 40-mile portion of SH 130 from its currently projected terminus at I-35 near Buda to its linkup with Interstate 10 at Seguin. Segments 1 thru 4, from Interstate 35 north of Georgetown to the Buda area, have already been funded and are under construction. This request for segments 5 thru 6 covers the last remaining unfunded section of this reliever route for I-35.$1 million for the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Communication Link: This project will establish a center-to-center communication links between Transportation Management Centers in San Antonio and other Texas cities. This project will also help facilitate traffic management advisories in the city, which can be essential during times of natural disasters or emergency evacuations. $3 million for Cesar Chavez: This project will convert Cesar Chavez, a major route to downtown, to two-way traffic for its entire 2.25 miles between MO-PAC and I-35. $1 million for Austin bicycle routes: This funding is for a Bicycle and Pedestrian program throughout the City. $2 million for State Highway 71: Applies to the four-lane expansion project from the Oak Hill area westward to its intersection with US 281.$3 million for US 290: This project will upgrade US 290 from east of Williamson Creek to west of FM 1826. Currently, the US 290 Freeway ends east of William Cannon Drive and transitions into a four-lane divided roadway.Smith also noted that he was able to obtain approval for the future construction of a $350 million commuter rail project in the bill. Once completed, commuter trains will run on existing rail lines along the I-35 corridor. The effect of this is that it puts the commuter rail project in line for future funding.In addition, Smith announced that the Travis County Congressional delegation obtained approval to fund Austins Rapid Bus Project and the Urban Commuter Rail Project in the bill.
03.10.2005	The Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), the lobbying arm of the high-tech industry, today named Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) as one of its 2005 Legislators of the Year for his strong support of legislation to help the high-tech industry.I want to thank the Information Technology Industry Council for this honor, said Rep. Smith. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Intellectual Property Subcommittee, I have worked closely with ITI to ensure that Congress protects the interests of the high tech community.Lots of legislators talk the talk when it comes to supporting tech, but Lamar Smith has walked the walk, ITI President Rhett Dawson said.

Each of the award recipients has achieved high scores on ITIs biannual High-Tech Voting Guide, the only scorecard rating Members of Congress on their support for high-tech policies.Rep. Smith, who had a 100% ITI rating last Congress and has a 94% lifetime rating, has been a leader on patent and copyright issues that affect the tech industry.
03.10.2005	The United States Chamber of Commerce today presented Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) with its Spirit of Enterprise award for his strong support of a pro-economic growth legislative agenda in the second session of the 108th Congress.It is an honor to receive this award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Smith said. As our economy continues to expand, Congress must remain committed to policies that create jobs and economic opportunities.It is critical to have members of Congress fighting for American business and their employees at this time of economic expansion and opportunity, said Thomas J. Donohue, Chamber President and CEO. Lamar Smith is a leader who has voted time and again to create jobs, improve our domestic security, and promote economic expansion.The Chamber gives the Spirit of Enterprise award based on its rankings of Members of Congress for key business votes which are explained in its annual publication, How They Voted.

03.09.2005	The House Judiciary Committee approved the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act today, a bill authored by Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) that allows parents to use technology to shield their children from offensive movie content at home. The legislation now moves to the House floor for consideration.The bill contains three main sections, including the Family Movie Act, the Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act and the Preservation of Orphans Works Act. The Family Movie Act addresses a growing concern among parents about the level of sex, violence and profanity their children are exposed to in movies. The bill permits the use of an electronic device, incorporated into a DVD player, which allows parents to skip or mute objectionable content at home without violating copyright law."I feel strongly that parents should decide for themselves what their children see and hear on television," Smith said. "These days, I don't think anyone would even consider buying a DVD player that doesn't come with a remote control. Yet there are some who would deny parents the right to use an equivalent electronic device to protect their children from offensive material on television," Smith said."Parents should be able to mute or skip over anything they want if they feel it's in the best interests of their children," Smith commented."The Family Movie Act ensures that parents have such rights," Smith said.The Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act creates new penalties for those who camcord movies in public theaters and who willfully infringe copyright law by distributing copies of pre-release movies or other works online."This piracy harms everyone from those looking for legitimate sources of content to those who create it. This bill will protect creative works and ensure that all those involved in the production of a film are not cheated out of their just compensation," Smith said.The Orphan Works Act ensures that libraries and archives have greater access to copyrighted works.Rep. Smith is Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property.
03.03.2005	Congressman Lamar Smiths (R-San Antonio) Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 cleared a major legislative hurdle in the House of Representatives today. The Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property approved the legislation and that clears the way for the bill to be considered by the full committee. Smiths bill allows parents to use technology to shield their children from objectionable movie content at home and protects intellectual property rights. It contains three main components: The Family Movie Act, the Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act and the Preservation of Orphans Works Act. The Family Movie Act addresses a growing concern among parents about the level of sex, violence and profanity their children are exposed to in movies. The bill allows parents to use technology to skip over unwanted movie content in the home without violating copyright law or infringing on the artistic rights of directors.Parents should be able to mute or skip over anything they want if they feel its in the best interests of their children, said Smith.Just as the author of a book should not be able to force someone to read that book in any particular manner or order, a studio or director should not be able to force parents or their children to watch a movie in a particular way, continued Smith.No one can argue with a straight face that it should be against the law to skip over a few pages or even entire chapters of a book. So, too, it should not be illegal to skip over a few words or scenes in a movie. The Family Movie Act ensures that parents have such rights, Smith noted.Raising children may be the toughest job in the world. Parents need all the help they can get, said Smith.The Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act creates new penalties for those who camcord movies in public theaters and who willfully infringe copyright law by distributing copies of pre-release movies or other works online.The protection of intellectual property rights is vital to the movie industry, stated Smith. This bill ensures that the persons involved in the film industry are not cheated out of their due compensation.The Orphan Works Act ensures that libraries and archives have greater access to copyrighted works.Rep. Smith is Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property.
03.03.2005	Texas Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) announced today that he has been re-elected to serve on the House Committee on Homeland Security for the 109th Congress. "I am pleased to continue my service on this important panel. With responsibilities ranging from protecting our borders and airports to ensuring that this nation is prepared for biological, chemical, or nuclear attack, the tasks before the Homeland Security Committee are among the most difficult challenges facing the nation today, Smith said.The Committee has primary jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security and government-wide homeland security policy. Smith will serve on the Committees Subcommittee on Economic Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Cybersecurity and its Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Science, and Technology.He noted his subcommittee appointments are important to his district given its proximity to the border and the presence of numerous cybersecurity and high tech firms in Austin and San Antonio.Although we often fear a breach of our nations physical borders, we must not forget that a breach of cybersecurity can be just as devastating. Our nation depends on computer networks, telecommunications and advanced technologies to manage our daily lives. We must remain vigilant in developing more ways to bolster our cybersecurity, Smith said. In addition to his Homeland Security assignment, Smith is Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property. He also serves on the House Science, Ethics and Republican Steering Committees.
03.01.2005	A recently exposed hoax in which an individual delivered a false death notice to the wife of a Ft. Stewart soldier serving in Iraq has prompted Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) to call for the use of a new federal law he designed to prosecute the responsible person.In the following letter sent to the Judge Advocate General of the Army today, Smith made known that under his Stop Terrorist and Military Hoaxes Act of 2004, criminal penalties now exist for individuals who provide false and misleading information about the death of a member of the Armed Forces during a time of war. Smith was joined by Reps. Jack Kingston (R-GA), Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Thaddeus McCotter (R-MI) on the letter.Major General Thomas J. RomigJudge Advocate General Department of the Army2200 Army PentagonWashington, D.C. 20310Dear Major General Romig, Last week various media organizations reported that an individual at Fort Stewart perpetrated a cruel hoax in which he delivered a false death notice to the wife of a solider serving in Iraq. Obviously, these actions are outrageous and deserve serious consequences. That is why we worked to pass of the Stop Terrorist and Military Hoaxes Act of 2004, which was signed into law last year as part of Public Law 108-458. Tragically, some have used the shadow of fear cast by the 9/11 attacks and the war in Iraq to further terrorize others with hoaxes. These hoaxes continue to grow in number and variety. As we saw this week, some have terrorized the families of our military men and women by falsely claiming their loved ones have been killed in action. Such conduct is reprehensible, and that is why the new law provides additional criminal penalties for individuals who prey on our military families. The law specifically includes a provision to penalize individuals who make a false statement, with the intent to provide false and misleading information, about the death of a member of the Armed Forces during a time of war. While we certainly hope that hoaxes will end, the Stop Terrorist and Military Hoaxes Act should be a useful tool for you in situations like the recent hoax in Fort Stewart. We hope you succeed in bringing the person responsible to justice and that you can use this new statute to full advantage as you do so. Sincerely, Lamar SmithMember of Congress
02.17.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) today voted for a class action reform bill to preserve the integrity of the American justice system. The House of Representatives approved the measure 279 -149.The Class Action Fairness Act is a bipartisan, sensible bill that clarifies the rights of consumers and restores confidence in Americas judicial system. It reforms the class action system and addresses the abuses that harm so many Americans, Smith said.Weve all heard of the lawsuits in which the plaintiffs walk away with pennies “ sometimes literally - while their attorneys walk away with millions of dollars in fees, Smith said. This problem will be addressed under this bill by providing greater scrutiny over settlements that involve ˜coupons or very small cash amounts.This legislation also ensures that deserving plaintiffs are able to make full use of the class action system. It allows easier removal of class action cases to federal courts. This is important because class actions tend to affect numerous Americans and often involve millions of dollars. Federal court is the right place for such large lawsuits, Smith said. Moving more class actions to federal courts also prevents one of the worst problems in class actions today “ forum shopping, Smith added.Smith did note, however, that he was disappointed that the bill does not include a provision he offered as an amendment last year to the House version of the bill. The provision would have prevented a ˜rush to the courthouse by applying the new law to cases that have been filed, but not yet ˜certified as a class action, Smith noted.While many concessions were made on both sides, this is still a worthwhile bill that contains many good reforms, and I fully support it. I look forward to its enactment into law, Smith concluded.
02.16.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) introduced the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2005 or Open Government Act today, legislation designed to give the public more access to information and insight into the workings of government by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) is the bills sponsor in the Senate. The Freedom of Information Act performs a vital check and balance on the federal branch. It protects our open system of government and ensures that the government responds to the American people, Smith said. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining government information is overly burdensome and federal agencies have become less and less responsive to requests for information, Smith noted. This deters citizens from seeking information to which they are entitled. Taxpayers should have the opportunity to obtain information quickly and easily. This legislation will greatly improve the publics right to know what the government is doing in their name, Smith concluded.The bill does the following:¢ Creates a broader definition of news media so that all types of news media, including smaller, non-traditional outlets, can obtain government documents at minimal cost.¢ Allows more individuals to recover attorneys fees when they are on the winning side of litigation to get information from the government.¢ Tightens up time limits for government agencies to respond to FOIA requests.¢ Requires government agencies to implement a system that enables individuals to track their request for information.¢ Creates a new Office of Government Information Services to ensure that FOIA requests in all government agencies are promptly and thoroughly handled.
02.09.2005	During House debate on the Real ID Act today, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) noted that the bill is just one step needed to secure the nation from future terrorist attacks. Smith stated that if the Administration wants to continue to protect the lives of Americans, it should take immediate steps to change policies that have encouraged illegal immigration. Passage of the Real ID Act is needed to close obvious loopholes in our homeland defense. It is the first step back on the long road to real homeland security, Smith said. But we cannot secure our homeland unless we know who is entering our country, why they are here, and how long they stay. There can be no homeland security until illegal entries are stopped.Smith noted that the Administration should begin this effort by requesting funding for the border enforcement positions that Congress authorized last year. The Presidents budget only requests enough funds for 210 new Border Patrol Agents, even though Congress authorized 2,000 new agents, Smith commented. Another area that Smith called on the Administration to address is the enforcement of penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal workers. The Administration must start fining employers for hiring illegal immigrants. Last year it didnt fine a single employer, Smith said. Smith also called on the Administration to change its policy of recognizing consular identification cards issued by other countries. These cards are not considered reliable or secure. They simply give terrorists and illegal immigrants another way to remain undetected in the United States, Smith said. Smith concluded, The REAL ID Act marks the beginning of an effort to make America safer. I hope the Administration will fully support us in this effort.
02.02.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) announced today that he has been re-appointed to serve on the House Committee on Science for the 109th Congress. "I look forward to continuing my service on the Science Committee," Smith said. "With jurisdiction over issues ranging from the nation's space program to scientific research at our universities, this assignment ensures that Texas has a strong voice on matters vital to our region."The Science Committee has jurisdiction over all non-defense federal scientific research and development. Federal agencies that fall under the committee's jurisdiction include: NASA, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, Federal Aviation Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Fire Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey.Smith noted that as a member of the Science panel, he will continue his service on the Space and Research Subcommittees.Smith's selection to the Science Committee completes his committee assignments for the 109th Congress.In addition to the Science Committee, Smith will continue to serve on the Judiciary Committee as Chairman of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee and as a member of the Immigration Subcommittee. He will also serve on the Homeland Security Committee, which is charged with oversight of protecting the United States from terrorist attacks. Smith announced earlier that he has also been asked by the Speaker of the House to serve on the Ethics Committee this session, and he will retain his position on the Republican Steering Committee. The steering panel appoints the chairmen and members of House committees.
02.02.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) announced today that he has been selected to serve on the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. The bipartisan panel is commonly referred to as the Ethics Committee.The Ethics Committee has jurisdiction over all bills, resolutions and other matters relating to the Code of Official Conduct in the House of Representatives. "When someone joins this committee, they make a solemn vow to protect the integrity of the House of Representatives," Smith said. "That means that every decision has to be based on the merits, not partisanship. I am flattered that the Speaker of the House felt I could contribute."Smith previously served as a member of the committee from 1997 to 2001. He served as the panel's chairman for two years.
02.02.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) joined with several of his Congressional colleagues today to endorse class action reform:The Class Action Fairness Act is a bipartisan, sensible bill that clarifies the rights of consumers and restores confidence in Americas judicial system. It reforms the class action system and addresses the abuses that harm so many Americans, Smith stated. Class actions are lawsuits involving hundreds or sometimes thousands of plaintiffs who sue together. Many class action suits have become nuisance lawsuits because attorneys abuse them in state courts. Attorneys receive large fees while class members walk away with mere coupons or very small awards.Weve all heard of the lawsuits in which the plaintiff walks away with pennies “ sometimes literally “ while their attorneys walk away with millions of dollars in fees. This problem will be addressed under this bill by providing greater scrutiny over settlements that involve ˜coupons or very small cash amounts.Smith continued, [t]his legislation also ensures that deserving plaintiffs are able to make full use of the class action system. It allows easier removal of class action cases to federal court. This avoids one of the worst problems in class actions today “ forum shopping.He also noted that the bill includes a provision that he offered as an amendment last year when this bill was in Judiciary Committee. The provision prevents a ˜rush to the courthouse by applying the new law to cases that have been filed, but not yet ˜certified as a class action. It will prevent unscrupulous attorneys from trying to get around the reforms in this bill. Any case that has already been filed, but where the class has not yet been certified, will have the new rules applied to it.Smith, who recently met with President George W. Bush on class action reform, said he is looking forward to the President addressing the issue in his State of the Union address tonight.
01.26.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) today was re-elected Chairman of the House Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property. "Its an honor to be again selected to chair this subcommittee. The issues that this panel has jurisdiction over are among the most important to the nations entrepreneurial spirit and its growing technology sector, Smith said.The subcommittee has jurisdiction over issues related to copyright and patent law, information technology, the administration of U.S. Courts, Federal Rules of Evidence, Civil and Appellate Procedure, judicial ethics and Article III federal judgeships. It also has oversight over the federal governments Patent Trademark Office, Copyright Office, Copyright Royalty Tribunal, Administrative Office of the Courts, State Justice Institute and U.S. Attorneys. Intellectual property represents the single largest sector of the economy, Smith said. From software developers to cyber security experts, it is vital that we encourage the continued growth and protection of intellectual property. This post will continue to give me a unique opportunity to shape national policy in an arena of real importance at home.Smith noted that he will also retain his seat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, a panel he once chaired. It has jurisdiction over issues related to immigration and naturalization, admissions and settlement of refugees, foreign sovereign immunity, treaties, conventions and international agreements.
01.26.2005	Representative Lamar Smith is wasting no time in his mission to loosen the tightening grip of frivolous lawsuits over the American people and the nations judicial system.Today, the Texas Congressman introduced the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2005, legislation designed to prevent the filing of frivolous lawsuits. Over 30 of Smiths House colleagues have cosponsored the legislation.The filing of frivolous suits by attorneys across the nation has made a mockery of our legal system. Instead of concentrating on real cases that need timely rulings, our courts today are forced to wade knee-deep in a pool of false claims and unscrupulous plaintiffs, Smith said. These suits have increased insurance premiums and raised health care costs. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act: ¢ Permits judges to order plaintiffs to reimburse reasonable litigation costs, including attorneys fees; ¢ Makes sanctions against attorneys or parties who file frivolous lawsuits mandatory rather than discretionary;¢ Removes a "safe harbor" provision that allows plaintiffs and their attorneys to avoid sanctions for frivolous suits by withdrawing them within 21 days;¢ Reduces court-friendly shopping by requiring that plaintiffs in civil tort actions sue only where they live or were injured, or where the defendant's principal place of business is located.This measure holds accountable those who abuse our judicial system. It reinstates trust in our legal system, Smith concluded.While Smith won House of Representatives passage of the bill in the last Congress, the Senate was unable to act on the legislation before the end of last year, prompting Smiths reintroduction of the bill.
01.25.2005	Texas Congressman Lamar Smith (R) introduced The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 today, a bill to protect intellectual property rights and provide parents with the ability to safeguard their children from profanity, sex and violence in movies watched at home.The bill contains three sections to aid in this effort, including the Family Movie Act, the Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act and the Preservation of Orphans Works Act. The Family Movie Act addresses a growing concern among parents on the level of sex, violence and profanity their children are exposed to in movies. The bill allows parents to use technology to skip over objectionable movie content in the home without violating copyright law or infringing on the artistic rights of directors.Parents have a right to decide what their children see on television and no one should deny them that right. Fortunately, technology exists that shields children from violence, sex, and profanity. It is the electronic equivalent of fast-forwarding over unwanted content, said Smith. In todays busy age, parents need all the help they can get in raising their children.The Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act will deter the growing practice of using handheld technology to record and distribute movies by making it a felony to record a movie in a theater. It will also make it a violation to distribute a copyrighted work prior to its release or commercial distribution.The protection of intellectual property rights is vital to the movie industry. This bill is necessary to ensure that all those involved in the production of a film, from the director to the set carpenter, are not cheated out of their just compensation. It is vital to protect creative works, Smith said.The Orphan Works Act ensures that libraries and archives have greater access to copyrighted works.The provisions of the bill were part of a larger Intellectual Property package that passed both Houses of Congress last year, but was not enacted into law before the end of the session. Smith expects the House Judiciary Committee to take up the measure in the near future.
01.06.2005	Congressman Lamar Smith met with President George W. Bush this afternoon to discuss class action reform. It was a bipartisan meeting including members of both the House and Senate. Class actions are lawsuits involving hundreds or sometimes thousands of plaintiffs who sue together. Many class action suits have become nuisance lawsuits because attorneys abuse them in state courts. Attorneys receive large fees while class members walk away with mere coupons or very small awards. Congressman Smith asked President Bush to support a related idea “ the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act. This legislation passed the House last year.Frivolous lawsuits bankrupt individuals, ruin reputations, drive up insurance premiums, increase health care costs, and put a drag on the economy, stated Rep. Smith. Frivolous suits are brought, for example, when there is no evidence that shows negligence on the part of the defendant. These nuisance lawsuits make a mockery of our legal system, continued Rep. Smith.Rep. Smith noted to President Bush that his bill prevents forum-shopping. It requires that personal injury claims be filed only where the plaintiff resides, where the injury occurred, or in the state or county where the defendants principal place of business is located. This provision addresses the growing problem of attorneys who shop around the country for judges who routinely award excessive amounts.When Rep. Smith was first elected to Congress, President Bush was his constituent in Midland, Texas.
12.07.2004	Rep. Smith issued the following statement regarding the 9-11 legislation: The 9-11 Commission reviewed 2.5 million pages of documents, interviewed more than 1,200 individuals and held 19 days of public hearings. It made 43 recommendations, some of which are included in the bill before the House today. Unfortunately, the legislation fails to include many of the recommendations that will make Americans safer because the Senate has opposed them.This legislation sets no federal standards for the issuance of drivers licenses despite the fact that nineteen September 11th terrorists had 63 valid licenses. Some were in the country illegally because they overstayed their Visas. Individuals in our country illegally should never receive drivers licenses. Its why the 9-11 Commission wisely recommended one uniform, national standard. Texas is one of forty states that now bar illegal aliens from obtaining drivers licenses. If this bill is signed into law terrorists will still have the ability to acquire licenses in the ten states that have no standards. The 9-11 terrorists used their licenses to travel freely, open bank accounts and board airplanes. The Senate also refused to consider threat-based terror funding. Grants are distributed to states based on a formula that makes little sense. The formula guarantees that all 50 states - regardless of risk or need “ will receive federal assistance. This broken formula has had consequences for Texas. In federal funding per capita for first responders our state ranks fiftieth of the fifty states. We are slightly ahead of that other small state, California. Wyoming, the least populated state, leads the nation.San Antonio is the nations 8th largest city; Austin in the 16th largest city. We have a 1,200 mile porous border with Mexico. We have 14 maritime ports, and an airport “ Dallas-Ft. Worth “ that is bigger than New York Citys Manhattan Island. Clearly, the threat we face is graver than other parts of the country. I support legislation that will base federal funding on risk of attack, a provision dropped from this legislation at the insistence of the Senate.This bill does not identify lessons learned and does not change the law to prevent terrorists from exploiting our laws the way they did on September 11th, 2001. That is why I oppose it.Rep. Smith is a member of the Select Committee on Homeland Security.
11.22.2004	Congressman Lamar Smith today announced that four bills he authored passed the House of Representatives: the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA), the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act (CARP), the Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement Act (CREATE) and a package of reforms to the H-1B and L Visa programs. Intellectual property represents the single largest sector of the economy, employing 4 million Americans. From software developers in Austin, Texas, to cyber security experts in San Antonio to songwriters in Nashville, Tennessee, it is vital that we encourage the continued growth and protection of intellectual property, said Rep. Smith. SHVERA extends for five years the transmission of signals by satellite. Americans living and working in rural and remote parts of our nation will continue to have access to the same kind of high quality, advanced communications services as do Americans living in cities and suburbs, stated Rep. Smith. Rep. Smiths CREATE bill encourages collaborative research and development projects involving American universities, public institutions and private companies. Todays biotech, pharmaceutical, and nanotechnology companies are among the foremost users of collaborative research strategies. Universities, including the University of Texas, which ranks fourth in the nation for granted patents, play a key role in fostering and developing new technologies, observed Rep. Smith.The H-1B and L Visa reform package exempts up to 20,000 Masters and PhD students from the annual 65,000 cap.This legislation focuses on opening the doors to those with the talents to contribute to our economic growth while closing the door on fraud and abuse, commented Rep.
